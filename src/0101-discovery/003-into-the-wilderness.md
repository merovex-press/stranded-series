# Chapter 3 - Into the wilderness

## Ephraim's Chambersburg escape - Chambersburg / O'brien's Smithy - Day

**November 30 1762** Ephraim is working in the back of the smithy, when Dorian & Mook-1 shows up asking to talk with Jeffry. Ephraim is immediately suspicious, and climbs the ladder to the loft. When Dorian overhears him asking Chester where he lives, he grabs what few possessions he has and uses a rope to escape through the loft's door to the ground below, obfuscated from the road. He runs into MOOK-2 who is waiting for such a move, and the ensuing fight alerts _MOOK-1_ and Ephraim runs away. Dorian warns Chester that they will be back, and he, _MOOK-1_ and others pursue Ephraim. Ephraim steals a horse and gallops away, under pursuit. The race goes until night, with Ephraim fretful that he escaped. He headed into the wilderness. He lets the horse go, hoping it will distract Dorian's team. Hearing their hushed voices, he realizes the hunt is not over.

## Ephraim captured by Dorian - Wilderness - Dawn

Through the night, he continues to evade Dorian's men. Thinking he is safe, he falls asleep, only to awake with Dorian & his nine (9) men surrounding him.

## Kariwase ambushes Ephraim & Dorian

Kariwase & his band pick up on the pursuit and follow. They surround Dorian's team when they surround Ephraim. Due to the weapons, they opt to attack at dawn, when the English are the most tired. They open fire, killing _MOOK-1_ and alerting Dorian's men. Given they are veterans of the French & Indian War, they respond accordingly.

## Ephraim escapes Ambush

During the ensuing fight, Ephraim finds an opening in a large hollowed log that he crawls through. This lets him get outside Dorian's containment. As the fight shifts, he is able to emerge again after the Indians have passed, allowing him to escape their containment. He is shoeless, but able to disappear.

## Kariwase's indians pursue Ephraim

Kariwase's team captures or kills much of Dorian's team. MOOK-2 and two others beat a hasty retreat to civilization. Kariwase's headcount yields one missing. They find the shoes and realize he is on foot. The pursuit resumes with Kariwase's team hunting Ephraim.

## Ephraim falls into the Temple

Resting, Ephraim overhears the Indians, and continues to flee. They finally are able to see him on a mound and open fire. He runs like a rabbit, and falls into a hole. The Indians start to climb, when one observes it's an old haunted mound; they beat a retreat.
