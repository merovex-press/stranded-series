<!-- Synopsis: Biggs the rebel discovers advanced weaponry that he wants to use against the British when he is confronted with Pontiac's War.

Summary: Biggs is a former clergy who turned rabid anti-British patriot. He shows up at his brother's door while being pursued by Hunter, and flees when he finds his brother is Loyalist and turned him in, only to be chased by Indians and falls into a pit where he discovers advanced weaponry. He tries to smuggle the weapons back to his Sons of Liberty friends only to be exposed by a mole within the organization and sentenced to be hanged. Before the sentence could be carried out, Pontiac's War erupts and distracts the British, and Biggs decides to help the British against the Indians by giving up the weaponry which requires sneaking past the indians and then lifting the siege.
