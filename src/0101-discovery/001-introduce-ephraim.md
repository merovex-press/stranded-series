## Ephraim Seeks Refuge

**September, 14 N.S. 1762.** It was a dark and stormy night. Ephraim Biggs stood under the building's eave as rivulets of rain poured over its edge. Between lightening flashes, he could see the lane ahead. Puddles of brown rain collected and formed a small stream. _Four more doors._

Ephraim hued up and bolted down the lane. A nearby bolt of lightening flashed and thunder roared at the same time. The nearness scared him. He dove down, into a mud puddle. As suddenly as the lightening came, Ephraim felt foolish for jumping into the mud.

He stood and shook himself off. He picked up his bag and continued down the lane. After two steps, he stopped. Mud on his face oozed toward his eyes. He looked up into the rain, letting the water help him wash the mud from his face away.

Soaked to the bone, he stopped running down the lane. It was a cold, dark rain, but in a few minutes he would be warm and dry.

He walked up to the house that the Widow Piper's Tavern keeper said belonged to Jeffry Biggs. Light cracked through the shutters signaling they were still awake. He straightened his coat. With his fist, he pounded on the door. He waited a few moments, then repeated his pounding.

The door opened. Jeffry Biggs pointed a flintlock pistol at Ephraim. "Who is it?"

Ephraim looked at the pistol. It was at half-cock, the primer pan down. "Your brother, Jeffry."

"I don't have a brother named Jeffry."

"Don't be an ass. It's me, Ephraim."

Jeffry hesitated before tilting the pistol up. He grabbed the hammer with his thumb and decocked the pistol. Ephraim flinched. It was a bad habit their father taught both of them. At least he pointed the barrel away safely. "Not like that."

Ephraim removed his hat before he crossed the threshold. He shook the rain off of it. He handed it over to Jeffry. He then took off his long coat, still covered in mud.

Jeffry motioned to a chair on the porch. "Leave that on the chair. We'll take care of that in the morning."

Ephraim lay the coat across the chair's arms. He looked back at his brother to see if there was anything else he needed to do.

"Enter."

Ephraim crossed the threshold. The house was warm. The faint wood smoke at the fire coaxed Ephraim to relax for the first time in a week.

"Barbara, would you mind warming up some soup?"

Jeffry's wife Barbara set down her needlework. "Certainly. Good evening, Ephraim." As she stood, Ephraim noticed the slight bulge that would be a new niece or nephew. He was there when their first was stillborn. Peggy and Jeffry junior would be asleep upstairs.

He started to shiver. "Evening." Without asking, he moved a nearby three-legged stool closer to the fire and sat.

"Do you need a blanket?" she said.

He shook his head. "Rum?"

Jeffry said, "I'll get that." He went to a cabinet to get a mug and the rum.

Barbara moved a near-empty pot of soup back onto the fire. "We just finished a short while ago, so it won't take long."

Jeffry handed the rum to Ephraim, and stood back. Ephraim could feel the---it was not quite a glare or a stare. It was that annoyed look Jeffry had when they were younger. It was a familiar look. Ephraim preferred to sip the rum to warm him and let the fire slowly dry him.

After a bit, Jeffry sat at the table. He put his glasses and picked up his quill and started reading. He made notes as he went. Every few moments, he would pause and glance toward Ephraim before returning to his work.

Barbara gave Ephraim some soup, then resumed her needlework.

It remained quiet for quite some time. Ephraim finished the soup and milked the rum. His clothes dried up. Most of the mud was on the longcoat on the porch.

Jeffry set down the papers, quill and glasses. "Alright, what's all this?"

Ephraim noted frustration and exasperation in his voice.
Ephraim took another sip of rum to buy a few more seconds. He thought through what he had rehearsed en route. He never found a way to make it sound less incriminating.

"I need a place to stay a while."

"You have a place. Philadelphia."

"I'm thinking of moving West a bit. Philadelphia is a bit too modern. Right? That's why you left."

"I left because there were too many lawyers there, and not enough here. As soon as the wilderness is opened up they will need lawyers."

Ephraim mumbled, "people go West to avoid lawyers."

"What's that?"

"I said that's very enterprising of you. I'm sure Pennsylvanians will find comfort in knowing the law is with them in the wilderness. Maybe you can lawyer your way into subduing the savages."

"You mean the Shawnee? The Cherokee? Many of them are adopting our modes of dress and law. Some are starting to write in their own language. Being out here--I think I can help subdue the savages with the law, as you say." Jeffry poured rum into his own mug, then poured some into Ephraim's.

"Don't you think they would be happier if we stayed where we were and minded our own business?"

Jeffry laughed. "I don't right care what they prefer. Locke was right, if they were the rightful owners of this land, it would be prosperous like England. Instead, they left it a wasteland. We English are more enterprising. We will subdue the Earth as divine law decreed. My way is more civil. Would you rather they adopt English law or French?"

"You know I don't care one way or the other."

"Right, you don't even agree with the appeal to divine law."

It was a subtle barb, and one that did not get through Ephraim's skin. "I learned all about God I needed in seminary. Look, I need a place to stay for while."

"Why not Philadelphia? You had a place there. You had one in New York before that. New Haven was your home for a time before that. I don't think you have a home here."

"I'm not looking for a home. Just a place to stay while I find a home. I don't think these crossroads are where I will end up. Although, I did not see a smith."

Jeffry clinched his jaw. "There is a smith, and he barely makes ends meet. Getty's tavern brings most of his work. I don't think another smith is what this place needs."

"I don't think this place could handle two Biggs, either."

Jeffry smirked, "it's Bigg enough with one. Don't be coy."

Ephraim feigned innocence. It was an old joke.

"Why are you really here?"

Ephraim finished his rum. "I just need to get away from Philadelphia, that's all."

Jeffry glared at him, just like their father used to. "I will let you stay a few days. After that, you should continue down Wagon Road."

## Ephraim Finds Refuge

<!-- Fort Morris: Built as a log stockade with four bastions enclosing officers quarters, three barracks, storehouses, a guard house and a well. -->

<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambersburg,_Pennsylvania#European_settlement -->
**September, 17 N.S. 1762.** A few days in Shippensburg was all Ephraim needed. On the first day, he toured the town. He was surprised to find the log stockade fort, Fort Morris. It was inactive, but represented English rule nonetheless. He learned it was built to protect this part of the Wagon road during the French & Indian War after Braddock was slain. Given that many of the town's buildings, including Jeffry's house, were made of stone, it struck Ephraim oddly that the fort was wood.

The Widow's Tavern was another inducement to move on. Its clientele included trappers, traders and redcoats. Lobster backs. He needed to get further away. At least until things quieted down. Falling Springs was appealing. It had a fort, privately owned, and few settlers. It was much smaller than it used to be, which meant it may soon resettle. Ephraim worried that hostilities had only recently paused near Falling Springs. It could resume. He thought Jeffry was mad to settle so close to the wilderness with Barbara and their children.

* * *

On Tuesday before dawn, he set off for Falling Springs. It would be a long walk---about ten miles---and a less awkward farewell. He helped himself to some cold chicken, and some shillings paper his brother absentmindely left on the table the night before. His brother did not ask where he was going, so he did not tell him. _All the better._ Ephraim thought. _The fewer who knew the better._

He passed a few travelers on the road. Most were travelers. All were armed. With each mile, Ephraim felt more conspicuous wearing attire more suited for Philadelphia than the wilderness. Not a few of the travelers eyed him with suspicion or derision.

Not long before noon, he arrived in Falling Springs. As he had heard, there were more buildings than needed for the inhabitants. A good place to start over.

He made his way straight for the smith. He found it near Conococheague Creek, not far from Chamber's fort. It was odd to him that the log fort in Shippensburg filled him with more dread than Chamber's. Falling Springs oddly mirrored Shippensburg with its wooden houses and stone fort. It was as if Judge Shippen expected his settlement to withstand the test of time, and Chambers did not. Or, it could be because Shippen started earlier. Ephraim thought the war brought a lot into question.

The smith pumped the bellows as Ephraim entered. The smith's back was to the entrance, and he focused intently on his work. Ephraim set his bag down and watched quietly for a few moments. He remembered working the bellows for his dad when he was a boy. A journey towards being a blacksmith diverted to divinity by fortune. The smith was perhaps a dozen years older than Ephraim, or a bit less than that.

After a few minutes, the smith turned. He looked less surprised than he was tired. "Are you going to just stand there? What do you want?" The Scotch-Irish brogue was intelligible enough.

Ephraim hesitated at the abruptness. "I did not want to distract you from your work."

"You have. What will it be?"

Straight to the point. "I'm looking for a job. I've worked in a smithy before. You seem a little short handed."

The smith shook his head. "Maybe a few years ago. It's the damned war. Most the townsfolk have moved back to Philadelphia, or been killed."

None of this surprised Ephraim. The war lasted nearly half his life. Bradford's _Pennsylvania Journal_ reported on the atrocities. It was a fact of life. "True. But, it's gotten quieter over the past couple of years. With the Navy beating the French and Spanish in the Indies, it will be over soon."

"Prophet, are ye? It may have quieted between the English and French, but not for us and the Indians." The smith forgot the bellows. "Just the other day, we hear word that Jim Walker just escaped the savages. He made the mistake of straying too far from Fort Loudon when the bastards shot his horse and mounted it saddle on him. Had he not the knife on him, he'd have been a goner. Heard that, did ye?"

Ephraim shook his head.

"Aye. They got him back to the Indian settlement when he was left with two of them. He fetches his knife when they were both asleep." The smith pantomimed cutting tied wrists. "Just like that, he's free. One of the bastards woke and they scuffled. He grabs the savage by the hair and plunged the knife into his throat." The smith enjoyed acting out the fight. "He said the other fellow woke when he heard his friend killed, but was so scared that he ran off. Mr. Walker only two weeks ago emerged from the wilderness back to Fort Loudon. So, I don't think the settlers will be back as soon as you think."

"Where's Fort Loudon?"

The smith motions over Ephraim's shoulder. "Off that way about a day's ride."

Ephraim concluded "that way" was further to the West. "When were they last here?"

"A few years. We haven't but one in ten that we had here when the war started. Ben plans to lay out a proper town at some point. Maybe then---"

"Then you need help."

The smith sighed. "When there's a town, yes. But that won't be for years."

"I need the work. Not for wages. Just to get on my feet and head down the road."

"To Fort Pitt?"

"No, down to Virginia, perhaps."

"Aye, perhaps. What's in Virginia?"

"My business."

"You got a name?"

Ephraim hesitated. The last thing he wanted was his name to attract attention. "Jeffry."

"Jeffry what?"

"Boydell." It came out of his mouth before he could think. Now he had to commit to it. "Jeffry Boydell."

"You're a dandy, Mister Boydell. I mean, look at you. Nobody dresses like that out here."

Ephraim looked down at his suit. It fit Philadelphia fashion with its skin tight breeches buckled at the knee. He had loosened the fitted blue waistcoat during the walk from Shippensburg, but the neckerchief hid that. The gold embroidery and buttons did stand out. The Smith's breeches were similar, albeit black, with a looser fitting brown waistcoat. None of the ruffles, embroidery or non-functional buttons.

"No way you're working in that. You've not worked a rough day in your life."

"My father was a smith, I'll have you know." He made a point of changing his accent a bit. He tried to sound rougher. "I 'prentised under him. I can work the bellows. I can do most of the work you would expect if you had a 'prentise. You're doing work you oughtn't do if you're the master smith. I can't do much about the suit. But, you can't judge a book by its cover."

"Humph." The smith considered Ephraim for a few moments. "Go on. Let me see your hands."

Ephraim held his hands out.

The smith grabbed the hand, and turned it palm up and back to palm down. "Not a dandy's hands. I'll give you that. Not quite rough, but not dainty. They've seen some work."

"As I said, I 'prentised under my father. He wanted something better of me and my brother. Don't let my attire deceive you. I can do just about everything you need."

"Everything, eh? We'll see about that. It would do to have a lighter load. I'll try you on and see if this works out, Mister Boydell. But, if you've not proved your metal by week's end, away with ya."

Ephraim noted the bite in the smith's warning. He thought back to the hot, sweaty days as a young boy. It just occurred to him that he may not be in the best shape to swing a hammer. He had to try. "There's something more?"

"Aye?"

"I'll need some place to stay." He lifted his bag. "All that I have is here."

"Och. There it is. Did you think that didn't occur to me, lad? Here I thought you've lived here in Falling Springs me whole life and I just now laid eyes on you. You're a daft one that." He motioned toward a ladder at the back of the shop, then pointed up. "There's the loft, for services rendered. But, until then, get this fire going again. I'm going for a piss."
