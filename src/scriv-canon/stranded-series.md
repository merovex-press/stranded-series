### 1815-1911: Post-Toltec Europe

Once the English defeat the French in 1815 with advanced Toltec weapons, the
Congress of Vienna is established. This redrew borders as per the standard
timeline. Other great powers were concerned over England's technology.

### 1763-1783: Point of Divergence

From the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until the end of the Seven Year's War of
1763, a philosophical and political rift occurred both in America and Britain.
Americans viewed Locke's Second Treatise of Government as a blueprint for social
change. The British viewed it as wasted paper. Benign neglect from the 1720s to
1740s resulted in colonists assuming more control for their affairs; home rule
\_de jure\_. This neglect was shattered during the Seven Year's War, but
Americans exploited the crisis with their more sophisticated understanding of
politics and emerged from the War debt-free and ready to assert its
independence. In England, Parliament weakened the Crown's control over politics
and the prerogative system, nearly reducing the Crown to a figurehead. George
III subverted that trend by taking control of Parliament in the years between
his coronation in 1760 and the end of the War in 1763.

Saddled with war debt and the need to protect North America, George's Parliament
enacted the Sugar Act, which reduced the tax on molasses. Americans rioted and
decried this as an intrusion into its home rule. The period known as the
American Troubles (1763-67) were pivotal in stabilizing British-American
relations and establishing the modern British Commonwealth.

During the Troubles, Crown and Parliament exploited American internecine
jealousies and prejudices to prevent this strain from flaring into mutiny.
George recognized the threat to stability and had Parliament invite American
colonies to send delegates to negotiate. An agreement similar to the earlier
home rule "Albany Plan" pitched by Benjamin Franklin in 1755 was agreed upon.
The Stamp Act of 1765 & Declaratory Act of 1766 never occur. Timelines
diverge.\[\^OTL-American-Troubles\]

\[\^OTL-American-Troubles\]: OTL: The watershed period from 1763-1767 divided
America and Britain. The Proclamation in 1763, the Sugar Act in 1764, Stamp Act
of 1765 and its repeal / Declaratory Act of 1766 and the Townshend Acts of 1767
progressively strained and broke relations. As cold hostilities turned to hot
war, moderates sought to halt the separation until by the 1777 Battle of
Saratoga it became clear no reunification was possible. Read

Toltec weaponry thwarted Pontiac's Rebellion in Summer of 1763, which prevented
the Declaratory Act from being enacted. Instead, King George sends a full
regiment to ensure the Ohio is retained and negotiations for American home rule
started. REMOVE

In 1765, Parliament invited a delegation from each of the mainland colonies to
work out differences that included Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas
Jefferson. This extended negotiation (1765-68) blunted Radical demands for
independence. However, a splinter from the Sons of Liberty continued the (now
unpopular) fight for American Independence. This splinter movement is a key area
of conflict in Discovery Season.

These negotiations led to legislation that addressed British North America
grievances and allowed both sides of the Atlantic to move forward in a tense
harmony.

\#\#\#\# Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769

The Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769 extended all customary rights & privileges
to native-English speaking white settlers in British North America. This created
some frustration with Caribbean Colonials. Many Caribbean colonists remedied
this by establishing residence in Charles Town, Carolina. However, this
addressed the IRL complaints of colonialists that they were not treated to the
rights they would have enjoyed had they remained home.

This disenfranchised French-Canadian residents as their native language was
French. Many raised their children speaking English to extend these rights to
them.

\#\#\#\# British North America Act of 1771

British North America sought representation in Parliament. The government
agreed, providing the colonies restructured. This act transformed the
continental colonies to six self-regulated provinces:

Canada,

New England (some called Camelot),

Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York),

Virginia (includes Maryland & Delaware),

Carolina,

& Georgia.

This act further gave those provincial governments representation in the
Parliament of the United Kingdom. Charlotina province is added in 1803,
encompassing IRL Northwest Territory United States. Parliament calculated this
reorganization of the colonies into provinces would create internal tension that
would allow England to retain control.

This created frustration among the joined colonies (NY, Maryland, Delaware,
Rhode Island & Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New Hampshire), especially
RI&PP as they sought to be more tolerant religiously than Massachusetts. This is
an example of Parliament's intentional friction within the provinces.

\#\#\#\# Rights of Religious Liberty Act of 1772

British North America sought religious liberty. Parliament sought its debts to
be paid and taxation for its recurring budget. Some of this budget paid Anglican
ministerial salaries. This act permitted provinces to manage their own religious
affairs. This effectively abolishes the Anglican church in British North America
except for Virginia and Carolina. Thus liberty was a province matter, instead of
individual. The lack of Anglican minsters removes British North America's
obligation to pay that portion of the budget. British North America provinces
are allowed to establish their own state religions.

Virginia and Carolina remained Anglican.

Canada was not allowed to have Catholics in government, but was otherwise
Catholic territory.

New England became officially Congregationalist (Puritan). Though the power of
puritanism lapsed a generation before, there is still enough friction between
the denominations.

Pennsylvania extended its religious tolerance through New York, making it a
bastion for downtrodden faiths.

\#\#\#\# War Debt Equity Act of 1772

In the \_quid pro quo\_ for the Rights of Religious Liberty Act, British North
America provinces agreed to take on half of the Government's debt incurred by
the end of the French & Indian War. Whether this meant war debt or total debt
was a matter of disagreement that was settled during the Napoleonic Era. The
Seven Years' War nearly doubled Great Britain's national debt, so the question
of whether British North America provinces accepted a quarter or half of the
debt was no small issue. Buried in this act was the liquidation of various debts
by prominent members of British North America society. This pushed the Sons of
Liberty into the fringe by bribing the elite.

### 1764-1840: The Indian Problem

At the end of the Seven Year's War, an estimated 4.5 million Indians lived in
North America.\[@calloway2007scratch\] Britain was sensitive to protect its new
territorial gains by not antagonizing them. In Summer 1763, Parliament debated
constraining its settlers on the Atlantic side of the Appalachian continental
divide as a suite of measures to establish greater control over the colonies and
improve Indian relations. Discovery of advanced weaponry and their role in
thwarting Pontiac's Rebellion tabled the Proclamation of 1763.

The home rule negotiation led to establishing new colonies in Indian territory.
Those colonies were expected to become provinces when full British sovereignty
was exerted and Englishmen were comfortable "in their hearths and homes."
Americans agreed to fund British Army operations to secure settlers in those
areas and accelerate this effort. They also formed local militia that operated
under Army authority. Mississippi colony welcomed a higher number of British
military veterans, leading to a strong military tradition in that region.

This is too American. The British would have handled it like they did India. See
\[@keay1995honourable\]

This agreement did not sit well with the Indians, who continued to harass
settlers. The 1768 Stanwix and Hard Labour treaties ceded control from some
indians, but not all. War flared up in 1774 and continued through
1782.\[\^indian-war-1770s\] The role of the French led to renewed hostilities
between France and England before France was ready. This led to a hot war
between the two sides from 1778 to 1783.

\[\^indian-war-1770s\]: OTL: This is consistent with history apart from the
impact on the American Revolution. British supported the indians until news in
1782 of the peace treaty. \[@WesternTheaterAmerican2020\]

The Ohio War of the 1780s flared up over increased white settlement, aided by
French agents and a splinter group from the Sons of Liberty who thought that
Ohio should become an independent nation. The Battle of Fallen Timbers of 1784
broke the back of Indian resistance. This paved the way for English settlement
of southern and western Ohio.

### 1783-1848: Eradication of African Slavery

\> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

\> Discuss actual trends in African Slavery in Britain in this era.

Without the American Revolution, the anti-slavery movement in England starts
earlier. Over this 50-year period (1772-1848), slavery was eliminated throughout
the British Empire.

- 1772 - Somerset's Case holds there is no basis for slavery in English law, and
  held that laws supporting slavery were against Natural Law. This extends to
  BNA.

- 1787 - Wilberforce's Anti-Slavery Society struggled against London Society of
  West India Planters and Merchants who fought against abolition of slavery.

- 1807 - During a break in the French Troubles, England de-legalizes
  trans-shipment of slaves on the Oceans and between non-connected provinces.

- 1833 - "Apprenticeship Act of 1833" ends slavery in all British holdings by
  stages & "apprenticeships." Chattel is immediately repudiated by Parliament,
  meaning that African children were born free. Slave owners were mollified by a
  tax break for each freeborn child. Slave owners were compensated by tax.
  American high-society slave owners were well-compensated, lower-class owners
  were not, leading to some animosity. Increased investment in Toltec technology
  helps blunt the need for slaves during the Apprenticeship Period (1833-1846).

- 1846-48 - Apprenticeships ended in American provinces (Virginia, Carolina,
  Georgia) to increase representation in Parliament, leading to local civil
  conflicts in each province by the lower class "masters," which was put down by
  General Scott.

### 1783-1815: French Troubles

> sought to use the treaty to give them time to rebuild and rearm. French
> diplomats believed that without France to keep the Americans in check, the
> colonists might attempt to revolt. The American Revolution was that
> much-desired revolt.\[\^paris-treaty-1763\]

\[\^paris-treaty-1763\]: Wikipedia. \_Treaty of Paris (1763)\_.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty\_of\_Paris\_(1763)

The negotiations between British North America and England and discovery of
Toltec Technology blunted the American desire to revolt.

- 1783-1815 - French economy collapses due to Seven Year's War debt and
  speculation and takes the government with it. The French Revolution is a
  decade early, ends the same but with American participation in Europe.

- 1802-1815 - War between France and most of Europe. Ended by British & American
  deployment of Toltec weaponry

The French economy struggles under reparations required in the Treaty of Paris
(1763). The government gets caught up in various schemes to pay the debt that
results in a popular uprising in 1783.

Napoleon is involved as a republican during the early stages of the struggle,
and gains power as expected. England takes control of New Orleans when Napoleon
moves on Spain, and keeps it. Napoleon sends troops in 1801, triggering the war
between England and France & Spain (the latter as a vassal to France).

This "Napoleonic War" is ended by British & American deployment of Toltec
weaponry in 1815. Napoleon is executed and a new French king is placed on the
throne. This ends the French Troubles.

The Louisiana Territory is kept by England as compensation for the war, and to
further safeguard English interest and control over Toltec artifacts.

\#\#\#\# Faster-than-Light Travel Physics via Wormholes

Faster-than-light travel is possible via wormholes, known as Slipstreams. IRL,
wormholes are a scientific conjecture, derived from the same equations that
describe black holes. We cannot conceive of how to get to or use a wormhole. In
Strand, however, wormholes are a convenient means of travel from one place to
another. People traverse wormholes using a Jump drive, with each wormhole
connecting between only two locations. Travel time is near instantaneous for the
jumping ship and its occupants.

A Slipknot is the term used by Toltecs and adopted by English (Laufknoten in
German, Trou de Biche (tru-de-beesh) in French, Hueco in Spanish, Orifício in
Portuguese).

### Neutrino Energy

Neutrino energy is a theoretical way of converting the kinetic energy of cosmic
into into direct current (DC) electricity.

The energy is converted by layers a conductive film, silicone film and graphene
film. The conductive film comprises silver, gold, copper, gallium or aluminum or
one of their alloys, in particular of a silver or gold alloy or an
aluminum-gallium alloy. Each film layer is very fine, measured in 100s of
nanometers. See Neutrino Power Cube\[sec:neutrino-power-cube\] for the
scientific application.

IRL Research:

- The neutrino is the source of abundant, clean, renewable
  energy.\[\^nutrino-energy\]

- Neutrinovoltaic - a low voltage system of 12/24/48V DC

- **Neutrino Film** is "a film made of metal or a metal alloy, in particular a
  film made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a so-called neutrino or ntrino
  film (registered trademarks), to a method of production and to a use of a film
  made of metal or a metal alloy." \[\^WO2016142056A1\]

- **Neutrino Power Cubes** are highly sophisticated power cells that have the
  advantage of being able to supply energy in complete darkness. They do this by
  harnessing the kinetic energy created by invisible waves of cosmic radiation,
  transforming it into micro-vibrations in a complex resonation process
  facilitated by super-symmetrical coatings on a stable substrate. And because
  these power cells can be stacked on top of one another, they are more compact
  and efficient than today's solar cells and far less easily
  damaged.\[\^Neutrino-energy\]

- **Neutrino Energy Harvesting** is when energy can be derived from many
  different sources such as radio waves, vibrations, heat, or light, and these
  sources can be either natural or artificial. Solar cells convert light;
  thermoelectric generators convert heat flux (temperature differences); and
  Neutrino Power Cubes convert vibrations caused by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos
  into electricity.\[\^Neutrino-Wiki\]

### Slower-than-Light Travel

Slower-than-light travel follows the IRL laws of physics. Access to Toltec
technology accelerates research, leading to efficient "Edison" drives.

\#\#\#\# Travel Times

The table below describes the constraints of space travel. Most space ships are
fuel constrained based on their acceleration ability, shown by the Duration.
Travel between Earth and the slipsteam is within the limits of those ships.
Those with extended durations can travel four times further than regular ships,
at the expense of crew comfort. Those ships could safely make it to Uranus and
back, but not to the Oort cloud.

- Civilian ships have a maximum acceleration of V-shift 3.

- Military ships have a maximum acceleration of 2G (V-shift 5.

- Slipknot (5AU), Moon, Mars (1.5AU), Uranus (19AU), Oort (0.3ly) columns all
  refer to travel time from Earth to those (average distance) locations.
  Distances between planets,\[\^sol-distance\] Oort\[\^oort-distance\] and Belt
  (1AU) \[\^belt-distance\] are estimated for the sake of simplicity.

The main (or core) population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into
three zones, which are based on what is known as "Kirkwood gaps". Named after
Daniel Kirkwood, who announced in 1866 the discovery of gaps in the distance of
asteroids, these gaps are similar to what is seen with Saturn's and other gas
giants' systems of rings. https://www.notion.so/1f5ce610ebbb44d68c53e3d4c847c22d
