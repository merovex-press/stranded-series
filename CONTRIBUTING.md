## Contributing

<!-- contributing -->
First of all, thank you for thinking of contributing. Writing is a largely solo effort, so direct contribution is unlikely with the exception of beta readers and editors. If you find a mistake somewhere, the reader community and I would love it if you would create an issue. I will review and address all legitimate issues posted.

Before creating an issue, please [check this list](https://github.com/Merovex/stranded-series/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a report, please include as many details as possible.
