### La Resistance

[♫ "One day to a new beginning Raise the flag of freedom high!" ♫](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables)

[Wherever](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWorld) [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) is, you'll always find La Résistance: A [Ragtag Bunch of Misfits](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits) using [The Power of Love](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove) and [Friendship](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship) to fight against a tyrannical rule, often to help put the [Government in Exile](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile) back into power. Always underdogs, they fight using guerrilla warfare and by [raising the rabble](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabbleRouser) of the people by [revealing unpleasant truths](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheResistance) about [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) they've been trying to hide, causing the oppressed peoples to shake off the yokes of their tyrant rulers. Usually led by a [Rebel Leader](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader) and armed via [Vehicular Turnabout](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularTurnabout). Expect them to be opposed by [Les Collaborateurs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs).

Almost inevitably, [The Hero](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero) will join La Resistance while the battle is already underway, and will grow to become a great champion in the fight against [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire). After all, [Hollywood](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory) usually [romanticizes resistance fighters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeVillified), for three reasons. The first is rooted in America's origins as rebels fighting the English during [The American Revolution](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution). The second is likewise [World War II](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII) where the conflict between the Resistance and [Nazi Germany](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany) fell, as close as it ever has, to clear divisions between right and wrong, and of course, [Cool People Rebel Against Authority](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPeopleRebelAgainstAuthority). In most cases in history and in [Real Life](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife), resistance movements are complex and confusing events. A common mistake is to confuse resistance movements with revolutionary movements, when this is not always the case. Some resistance movements *are* revolutionary, seeking to install a new regime to displace the old. Revolutions, needless to say, are complex, murky and at times brutal affairs. It has led in the past to the new regime forming [the new government](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss) which [can be as bad or worse than the old.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution)

Of course, people rarely like having it pointed out that [these groups are terrorists from the perspective of anyone who disagrees with them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters) and [Innocent Bystanders](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander) who may get caught up in the crossfire of said conflicts. This may be deliberately ironic, perhaps inviting a "we are [Not So Different](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent)" moment. Or, [the author might simply assume that the audience will always sympathize with rebel protagonists](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality) against [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire), [therefore moral justification of the rebellion is unnecessary and the rebels can get away with whatever is expedient](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero). This could be averted if the [Evil Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) really is evil and the rebels exercise chivalry and restraint.

Alternatively, La Resistance will be utterly incompetent and little more than an annoyance until the hero gets in there and shows them how it's done. Sometimes [their inner dissensions render them nearly unable to get anything done.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether) Expect at least one member of La Resistance to be [The Mole](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole), or a homegrown [Les Collaborateurs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs) sabotaging their efforts from the inside. La Resistance may even be defeated without the assistance of its enemy: when the only thing uniting it is opposition to [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire), they may end up clashing thanks to some point of ideology (generally portrayed as stupid) or method (generally portrayed as worthwhile).

Also alternatively, La Resistance may represent the [last remnants](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant) of the reactionary or counter-revolutionary cronies of the old regime fighting against the Revolutionary Progressive Forces. Once re-installed, the Resistance "heroes" decide to [Retcon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon) the revolution and institute [purges](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge) for the cause of revenge, and remind people why exactly they were toppled in the first place. In some cases, as it happened in some parts of [World War II](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII), the Resistance contains factions who want to restore the old regime and factions which want to bring a new regime, and these two factions might struggle during and after the war.

When La Resistance form the main ensemble of the show, or one of them, they'll frequently exhibit a mix of characters similar to [The Squad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad). However, they'll usually have [sneakier methods](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpySpeak), they tend to be more morally pragmatic and ruthless than most [Squads](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad), and in series like *[Battlestar Galactica](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003)* members becoming [Shell Shocked Veterans](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran).

Sometimes La Resistance can be [downright nasty](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeCivilized). Usually, though, even at its worst La Resistance will be the [Lesser of Two Evils](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesserOfTwoEvils). If not, [Grey-and-Gray Morality](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality) may be at play. In an interesting twist, if the resistance [is every bit as unscrupulous as](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil) [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire), then the hero will end up doing a bit of [Conspiracy Redemption](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyRedemption) or [forming a third faction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption). *Very* occasionally, La Resistance may even be the [Big Bad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad) rebelling against a peaceful government. Occasionally, La Resistance will be shown in a more [comedic light, where they don't do much besides sitting around debating theory](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolutionariesWhoDontDoAnything).

Eventually, La Resistance will either die out, or grow into [The Alliance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance) as it gains power, allies, and sympathizers.

For the villainous equivalent, see [The Remnant](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant). For the opposite of La Resistance, see [Les Collaborateurs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs). Sometimes La Resistance may not be heroes but *villains*, as happens in an [Enemy Civil War](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar).

Compare [Vigilante Militia](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMilitia) and [The Magnificent Seven Samurai](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificentSevenSamurai).

Not to be confused with the [First-Person Shooter](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter) series, *[Resistance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance)*. Or with WWE's French-Canadian [Foreign Wrestling Heel](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel) [Tag Team](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam) [La Résistance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LaResistanceWrestling).
