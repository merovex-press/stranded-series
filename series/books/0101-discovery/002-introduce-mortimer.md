## Mortimer Seeks Ephraim in Shippensburg

**November 10, N.S. 1762** Even with the leaves falling off the trees, Mortimer Bethlehem thought America was beautiful. At least the middle colonies part of America. New England had its beauties, more in the inhabitants than the scenery. The Carolinas were too hot and sandy. The Quakers managed to pick the best part of America. The further away from Philadelphia they rode, the more he enjoyed the scenery.

The road widened as they entered the town. The afternoon sun just started to dip below the tops of the trees. Sharpsburg, he thought they named it. As they rode through, it looked quaint enough. Grey stone buildings in the Georgian style. They were not going anywhere. He chuckled when he saw the wooden fort. He pointed it out to Dorian Mabbott. "Sharpsburg has permanent buildings but temporary fortifications. They should be glad hostilities are at an end."

"Shippensburg, sir."

"What?"

"We are in Shippensburg, sir. Named for Chief Justice Shippen." Dorian's tone was respectful.

"Quite right. Shippens-burg." He muttered its name a few times under his breath. "Still, he does have a beautiful wife."

"Who, sir?"

"His Honorable Judge Shippen."

"Yes, sir."

"Do you see the church?"

"Not yet, sir. I doubt he's in one. They're Presbyterians out in the country. He was trained in the Puritan tradition."

Mortimer chuckled at that. _Puritans are a tradition? Hardly._ "Damned separatists. The Church of England is the only civil church. God save the King."

His men repeated in unison, "God save the king."

"Still, I'll buy you a pint if he's not found in a church."

They rode until they came to the tavern. "Widow Piper's Tavern. Handsome structure, that. Such clean lines. I wonder who built it?" He shifted in his saddle. It had been a long ride. "Come on, let's give it some business."

He and his men dismounted and tied their horses. Mortimer paused a few more minutes to study the shape of the building. For an American tavern, it was not terribly large. Its size was more like the alehouses in London.

The ten of them entered the tavern. Describe interior.

- [ ]: TODO: Visit the Widow Piper's Inn

The common area was just large enough for his entourage. A woman, probably Widow Piper, worked the fire by the hearth.

"Good evening, madam."

She looked up. "How can I be of service?" The Scottish burr was distinct, unsoftened by her time in America.

"If you have lodging," pointing his hat at his men, "we will be staying the night."

She smiled. "Aye. No boarders today."

"Splendid. We've just arrived from." He paused an turned to Dorian.

"Harrisburg, sir."

"Yes. Quite. Harrisburg. Hard journey. We are famished."

"Well, you're in luck. We have a meat pie, hasty pudding with bacon, oatmeal porridge, a dish of eggs and beer. Should be ready in an hour."

"No ale, perhaps?" Mortimer said.

"Aye, ale beer."

After a pint, Mortimer's men took the horses to the nearby stable while Moritmer and Dorian remained. They were on their second pint. The prices were lower than Mortimer would have expected. It was a decent ale, even if too malty for his palette.

"Mrs. Piper. Have you recently had a visitor?"

"This is a tavern, sir. With all the travel between Philadelphia and the wilderness, we usually have several visitors. Usually redcoats or trappers. It starts to slow down about this season."

"Anyone by the name of Ephraim Biggs?" Dorian jumped in.

Mortimer felt a little exasperated. Dorian was younger, always in haste.

"No Ephraim Biggs. There is a Jeffry Biggs here in town."

Mortimer sat up a little. "Oh?"

"Aye. He lives just on the other side of the fort."

Dorian continued, "has he been here long?"

"He brought his family here a couple years ago. Once the indian troubles started to quiet down a bit."

"Pastor?"

"Oh, no. Worse. He's a lawyer."

"There does not seem to be much calling for the law out here." Mortimer injected.

"You'd be surprised. He works for Judge Shippen, who owns all the land around us. Once the war is over, they'll be selling plots of land. Mr. Biggs will be handling the surveys and sales. He usually comes in every morning for a beer and Indian pudding with the missus being with child."

* * *

The next morning, Mortimer and Dorian sat over breakfast and waited. Mrs. Piper described Jeffry to them, so they were prepared. They did not wait long. A somewhat tall man with reddish-brown hair came into the tavern.

"Jeffry!"

The man reflexively looked their way.

"Join us."

"I'm sorry. Who are you?"

"I'm Captain Bethlehem, and this is Ensign Mabbott. You are Jeffry Biggs, land broker?"

That seemed to put Jeffry at ease. He hesitated for a moment before joining them at the table. Mortimer observed his mannerisms as an odd mix of gentleman and commoner. Jeffry was pretending at being one, probably a gentleman.

There was serving bowl of Indian pudding. Mortimer pushed it toward Jeffry. He offered a spare bowl and wooden spoon to Jeffry, who took it from him. Jeffry filled his bowl. Dorian set a mug of ale at Jeffry's place. The three ate together, trading small talk for most of the meal.

"Thank you, gentlemen. We are not yet offering plots for sale. Once a peace treaty is signed, perhaps."

"I imaging in time Shippensburg will be a thriving city. Handsome countryside. We are not here for that. Have you heard from your brother Ephraim?"

Jeffry paused for a moment. It was almost imperceptible, but enough for Mortimer to know that he had. "No, I haven't. He should be in New Haven."

"Should be, but he is not. He left New Haven some months ago, and I'm tasked with finding him."

"Is he in some sort of trouble?"

Mortimer paused. As a younger brother, he would want nothing better but for his older brother to disappear. Then he would have title and would not be traipsing over the back side of America. Would Jeffry protect his brother or not? Mortimer decided confronting him with a hard statement would yield a worthwhile reaction. "I'm afraid he is. Ephraim Biggs murdered an English officer last June in New Haven. I've been dispatched to find him for execution."

Dorian started to react when Mortimer cut him off with a glare. It denied him the chance to see Jeffry's reaction.

"But--- No. I don't believe it. Jeffy isn't the murderous sort."

Mortimer let a silent pause work for him. Colonial Colonel Whiting hated playing All Fours against Mortimer because of his ability to read the other players. He tried those tactics here. When Jeffry looked down, he gave a glance and wink to Dorian. "Tried and convicted, I'm afraid. He managed to escape the jail soon after. Ensign Mabbott and I have been in pursuit ever since. He gave us a slip in Philadelphia, but we hear rumor that he headed this way. Pray, when did you last see your brother?"

"Not since he went to Yale."

It was a lie that Mortimer read easily. He opted to change tact. "Well, he must not have come this way, then. Ensign, you may have been right. He went to Baltimore." He noticed Jeffry relax his shoulders, though the look of shock on his face remained. "What amazed me that a Puritan ministerial student would be capable of murder with his bare hands. How is it that you became an attorney and he went a different path?"

"We weren't born into wealth, if that's what you mean. Our forefathers were smiths. Our grandfather came over after Queen Anne's War. Our father did well enough to send us to college so we could advance the family's position."

"So you worked in the smithy as lads? That would explain Ephraim's ability to crush a man's throat." Mentally, Mortimer moved the Biggs down several social pegs. Commoners pretending to be elitists. That was the mode in America, with men thinking they can climb some social ladder and forget their places. It was different for aristocrats. They already had their place. All that remained was jockeying for position.

The meal ended abruptly there. The interrogation stole whatever appetite Jeffry still had. He thanked them and left.

"What was that about?" Dorian said.

"About the conviction? I had to know whether Jeffry knew about the murder. I had to dress it up." He set back in his chair. He steepled his hands together, and tapped his upper lip. "His brother went through here, but failed to tell his brother why. I doubt they are very close. Jeffry is quite a few years older. Did you notice anything else?"

"They are smiths."

"Quite. Ephraim will not conceal himself as a pastor. Too obvious, and not as much call for that out here."

"You suppose he reverted to smithing?"

"It makes sense. Either that or he's fled the country and gone south." Ensign Mabbott had not been in America for long. Mortimer decided to size him up a bit. "What do you propose?"

"Well, we are close to Indian country. There are not too many places that could take a smith. He could have fled south, but his resources would only take him too far. I'll wager a pint that he is in a nearby town working as a smith."

"How do you propose we find out?"

"Divide our forces. Winter is fast approaching. But, if we send the men out a few days in any direction, we should figure out if he is in the area or has passed through."

_My thoughts exactly._ "Sobeit. Split the team and send them out. Have them all report back in a fortnight." Widow Piper's is a fine place for us to headquarter until they return. See to it."

## Ephraim Thrives in Chambersburg

**November 20, N.S 1763.** Ephraim wiped his brow. The long day's work had taken its toll. Not as much as it had the first few weeks, but enough to assure him he would sleep well tonight. He grinded from apprentice into journeyman at his father's smithy from the age of seven to seventeen. He knew his way around the shop. Had he kept at it, he would have become a master by 21.

It was grueling work, and his father wanted him to follow Jeffry's lead and become an attorney. This despite Jeffry's insistence that he study in Philadelphia, hoping to enter into Dr. Franklin's society.

The last think Ephraim wanted was apprentice to an attorney. He refused. For years his father continued the pressure for Ephraim to not become a smith. All the while, he toiled at the forge. Years of persistance paid off. Ephraim agreed to enter the ministry. It took a few years to prepare, but by seventeen he was admitted to Yale College. Over the past three years, he filled his mind with divinity, and his muscles weakened.

O'brien daily reminded Ephraim why he should have stayed at Yale. Not that he could under the circumstances. He would not be welcome in Connecticut ever again. He put that out of his mind and finished cleaning the shop. The sun was nearly set and he had not finished. It had been this way for weeks. He only got rest on Sundays, and spent most of his time then asleep. O'brien was getting the most out of the bargain that he could. Ephraim's income was limited to sleeping in the loft and foot from O'brien's table.

Taking a short break Ephraim looked out to the road that led back to Shippensburg. He saw a man walking, followed by a horse on its tether. The horse limped on its front left leg. Ephraim sighed. It would be nightfall before he finished.

He walked toward the man, shortening the distance. "Your horse. Bit of a limp?" His voice strained to speak though a dry mouth.

"I rode him across a stream a couple miles back. He slipped, and he's been limping since." The man was curt, his accent clearly English.

Ephraim took the lead and led the horse toward the shop's lamp. Inspecting, he saw a piece of stone caught in the hoof. He patted the horse gently as he set the leg back. He picked a pair of pliers off the workbench. He returned to the horse and lifted the leg. The horse started to shuffle. "He's worried. Calm him?"

The stranger moved up to the horse's head and stroked him. The horse settled. Ephraim grabbed the stone with the pliers and gently pulled. The stone was wedged in worse than it looked. He shifted and braced the leg more firmly and tried with more muscle. After a couple minutes, the stone came out.

Ephraim looked at the stone. It was flat and narrow, the sort of shale that everything seemed to be made out of. He held it up to the rider. "Pretty big piece. He's a tough one to walk as far as he did." He dropped the stone and inspected the hoof. There was only slight damage.

"Whoever shoed your horse did a fine job. If you can manage to stay off of him for a few days, he should be fine. If you have to ride him, take it easy. Maybe wade across with him if you have to cross another stream?"

The rider pursed his lips. "Sure. How much?"

Ephraim shook his head. "No charge."

"Is there somewhere I can rest?"

"There's an old tavern a bit that way. Most people seem to pass here from Shippensburg and go to Getty's ford and stay there."

"How far is that?"

Ephraim shrugged. He turned to O'brien. "How far to Getty's?"

"Getty's? Why? That's over the mountain."

"Isn't that where people go from Shippensburg?"

"No. Elizabethtown, down in Maryland. That's about another day's ride straight down the road."

"Aren't we in Maryland now?" the rider said.

"Depends on who's asking. The Penns say we're in Pennsylvania. The Calverts say Maryland. Colonel Chambers would prefer we were in Pennsylvania since he holds a land grant from them. That's his." O'brien pointed at the fort.

The rider studied O'brien and Ephraim. "It sounds like your Irish, old man. And you're American."

"Yes. From Philadelphia. Any reason?"

The rider shook his head. His voice derisive. "I could not imagine anyone working for the Irish. This continent perpetually amazes me."

O'brien closed on the rider. "You'd better be off to the tavern now."

Judging from the look of the rider, Ephraim knew if it came to blows between the Irish and English, O'brien would triumph. The scene faintly reminded him of New Haven.

The rider hesitated. "Forgive my manners. No offense intended. It has been a long day."

Ephraim nodded.

The rider touched his hat the way Ephraim had seen redcoats. The rider took the horse's lead and made for the tavern.

"Damned English. No matter where they go, they think they're the master."

"They are of us, for now."

"Aye. I've heard that before. Here is farther from England than Cork, but not far enough."

Ephraim chuckled, agreeing with the sentiment. "We'll have to see what happens when this war ends."

"If the last two are any indication, we'll be in another one by 1780. They seem to happen with every new king. You're young enough to see that one. I won't. It would be great to be rid of the English, but I have no fondness for the French, Spanish or Indian." O'brien sighed. His age showed more than Ephraim had noticed before. "At least there are a bunch of Germans around us. They seem content to be left alone. And the quakers are only trouble for them, not for me." He clapped Ephraim on the shoulder. "Jeffry lad, you've done a fine job. You know your way around a shop nearly as well as I."

"Thank you."

"But you know there's not a lot of work for the both of us."

"Telling me to move on?"

"Not yet. Weather's getting dank. I'll let you stay on through the season."

"You can stay in the loft, and I'll pay you what I can. That should give you enough to press on into Virginia come."

## Mook dies in Burnt Cabin / Sidneyville

**November 25, N.S 1763.**

<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannett_Township,_Franklin_County,_Pennsylvania -->
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnt_Cabins,_Pennsylvania -->

Mook heads down the trail toward Fort Pitt, over mountains, etc. 

Arrives in Fannet Township, which has just a couple families and very angry.

Mook continues West, arrives in village with burned cabins. Signs of recent habitation. Considers going further toward Ft. Pitt. Dreads being alone and encountering Indians. Decides it is a dead-end.

As he leaves the settlement, he is shot in the chest by Indians. Runs a bit, but loses strength quickly. Feels his head being grabbed and jerked as he starts to pass out from blood loss.

## Mortimer Picks up Pursuit

Fast forward a couple weeks when they find new smith hand in Falling Springs. One not returned from the area near Burnt Cabin, PA.

Mook 1 returns to Shippensburg. Reports to Mortimer.

Mortimer decides its the right place. Sends _Dorian Mabbott_. MOOK-1 and 7 other men to inquire further.
