    **Mortimer nearly arrests Jeffry** At the same time, Mortimer confronts Jeffry about Ephraim. The two get into an argument as Mortimer is convinced that Jeffry is hiding Ephraim now. Jeffry observes "when you engage in this sort of heavy-handed inquiry, the likes of my brother are proven right." Mortimer arrests Jeffry "to deprive the fox of his den." As they start to leave town, Boydell's word of Ephraim's presence in Philadelphia. Abashed, Mortimer decides to release Jeffry on gentlemen's honor that Jeffry will not alert Ephraim. "Of course not. He is a murderer." "And a traitor. He killed one of the King's men." "That only makes him a murderer." Mortimer heads to Philadelphia.
