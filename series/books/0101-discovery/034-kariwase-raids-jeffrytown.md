  synopsis: |
    **Kariwase raids Jeffrytown.** Kariwase's men attack Jeffrytown, with the similar result. Jeffry's wife & kids escape, while most of the others board up in the church. Kariwise burns the church, with he and his men watching it until the fire collapses the bell tower & the bell crashes. Cue anti-Christian/white sentiment. His men are scouring the countryside for strays, killing any they find.
