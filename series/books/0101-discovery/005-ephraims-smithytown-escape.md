     **Ephraim's Smithytown escape.** Ephraim is working in the back of the smithy, when Dorian & MOOK-1 shows up asking to talk with Jeffry. Ephraim is immediately suspicious, and climbs the ladder to the loft. When Dorian overhears him asking Chester where he lives, he grabs what few possessions he has and uses a rope to escape through the loft's door to the ground below, obfuscated from the road. He runs into MOOK-2 who is waiting for such a move, and the ensuing fight alerts MOOK-1 and Ephraim runs away. Dorian warns Chester that they will be back, and he, MOOK-1 and others pursue Ephraim.
