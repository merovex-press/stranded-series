  synopsis: |
    **Kariwase inspects Ephraim's handiwork.** Meanwhile, Kariwase discovers the slain Indian party. He initially suspects another Indian party. Further inspection discovers the missing shoes; and closer body inspection reveals the exit wounds. Looking about, they find the odd boots & a spent clip. They see the sled heading to civilization, leading Kariwase to assume it is an Englishman hauling a wounded or dead to civilization. Based on the age (dead bodies), he opts not to pursue, needing to meet with Pontiac.
