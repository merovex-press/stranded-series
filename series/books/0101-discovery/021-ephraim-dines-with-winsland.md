   **Ephraim dines with Winsland.** Ephraim arrives at the appointed time and dines with SOLOMON SHARPE & ADAIR WINSLAND (prominent citizen & SOL). Ephraim is behind on the news, which Solomon & Winsland gives him. He mentions he discovered something fantastic. He brought the lantern with him, so he first shows it. Then, he talks about the rifle, and they arrange for a rural demonstration at Winsland's farm the next day at noon.
