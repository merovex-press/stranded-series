  synopsis: |
     **Ephraim finds refuge in Smithytown.** Ephraim arrives in a nearby town at wilderness' edge (Smithytown) and asks a local smith CHESTER O'BRIEN to take him on for support (using an assumed name). The smith is grudging, but lets him do so. Later, Ephraim fixes a horse's hoof, foregoing compensation (overseen by Chester approvingly) He later catches Ephraim sleeping in the shop and takes pity by giving him a blanket, etc. They talk politics and Ephraim finds Chester is pro-Liberty.

<!-- Fort Morris: Built as a log stockade with four bastions enclosing officers quarters, three barracks, storehouses, a guard house and a well. -->

**17 September, N.S. 1762.** A few days in Shippensburg was all Ephraim needed. On the first day, he toured the town. He was surprised to find the log stockade fort, Fort Morris. It was inactive, but represented English rule nonetheless. He learned it was built to protect this part of the Wagon road during the French & Indian War after Braddock was slain.

The Widow's Tavern was another inducement to move on. Its clientele included trader and soldier. Redcoats. Lobster backs. He needed to get further away. At least until things quieted down. Falling Springs was appealing. It had a fort, privately owned, and few settlers. It was much smaller than it used to be, which meant it may soon resettle. Ephraim worried that hostilities had only recently paused near Falling Springs. It could resume. He thought Jeffry was mad to settle so close to the wilderness with Barbara and their children.

On Tuesday, he set off for Falling Springs. His brother did not ask where he was going, so he did not tell him. _All the better._ Ephraim thought. _The fewer who knew the better._

He left before dawn. It would be a long walk---about ten miles---and a less awkward farewell. He helped himself to some cold chicken, and some shillings paper his brother absentmindely left on the table the night before.

He passed a few travelers on the road. Most were travelers. All were armed. Ephraim felt more conspicuous wearing attire more suited for Philadelphia than the wilderness. Not a few of the travelers eyed him with suspicion or derision.

Not long before noon, he arrived in Falling Springs. As he had heard, there were more buildings than needed for the inhabitants. A good place to start over.

He made his way straight for the smith. It was near Conococheague Creek, not far from Chamber's fort. Ephraim was less intimidated by this fort than the one in Shippensburg, though this one was built from stone.
