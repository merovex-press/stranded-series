  synopsis: |
     **Ephraim finds refuge in Falling Springs.** Ephraim arrives in a nearby town at wilderness' edge (Falling Springs) and asks a local smith CHESTER O'BRIEN to take him on for support (using an assumed name). The smith is grudging, but lets him do so. Later, Ephraim fixes a horse's hoof, foregoing compensation (overseen by Chester approvingly) He later catches Ephraim sleeping in the shop and takes pity by giving him a blanket, etc. They talk politics and Ephraim finds Chester is pro-Liberty.

<!-- Fort Morris: Built as a log stockade with four bastions enclosing officers quarters, three barracks, storehouses, a guard house and a well. -->

**September, 17 N.S. 1762.** A few days in Shippensburg was all Ephraim needed. On the first day, he toured the town. He was surprised to find the log stockade fort, Fort Morris. It was inactive, but represented English rule nonetheless. He learned it was built to protect this part of the Wagon road during the French & Indian War after Braddock was slain.

The Widow's Tavern was another inducement to move on. Its clientele included trader and soldier. Redcoats. Lobster backs. He needed to get further away. At least until things quieted down. Falling Springs was appealing. It had a fort, privately owned, and few settlers. It was much smaller than it used to be, which meant it may soon resettle. Ephraim worried that hostilities had only recently paused near Falling Springs. It could resume. He thought Jeffry was mad to settle so close to the wilderness with Barbara and their children.

On Tuesday before dawn, he set off for Falling Springs. It would be a long walk---about ten miles---and a less awkward farewell. He helped himself to some cold chicken, and some shillings paper his brother absentmindely left on the table the night before. His brother did not ask where he was going, so he did not tell him. _All the better._ Ephraim thought. _The fewer who knew the better._

He passed a few travelers on the road. Most were travelers. All were armed. With each mile, Ephraim felt more conspicuous wearing attire more suited for Philadelphia than the wilderness. Not a few of the travelers eyed him with suspicion or derision.

Not long before noon, he arrived in Falling Springs. As he had heard, there were more buildings than needed for the inhabitants. A good place to start over.

He made his way straight for the smith. It was near Conococheague Creek, not far from Chamber's fort. It was odd to him that the log fort in Shippensburg filled him with more dread than Chamber's stone fort.

The smith pumped the bellows as Ephraim entered. The smith's back was to the entrance, and he focused intently on his work. Ephraim set his bag down and watched quietly for a few moments. He remembered working the bellows for his dad when he was a boy. A journey towards being a blacksmith diverted to divinity by fortune. The smith was perhaps a dozen years older than Ephraim, or a bit less than that.

After a few minutes, the smith turned. He looked less surprised than he was tired. "Are you going to just stand there? What do you want?" The Scotch-Irish brogue was intelligible enough.

Ephraim hesitated at the abruptness. "I did not want to distract you from your work."

"You have. What will it be?"

Straight to the point. "I'm looking for a job. I've worked in a smithy before. You seem a little short handed."

The smith shook his head. "Maybe a few years ago. It's the damned war. Most the townsfolk have moved back to Philadelphia, or been killed."

None of this surprised Ephraim. The war lasted nearly half his life. Bradford's _Pennsylvania Journal_ reported on the attrocities. It was a fact of life. "True. But, it's gotten quieter over the past couple of years. With the Navy beating the French and Spanish in the Indies, it will be over soon."

"Prophet, are ye? It may have quieted between the English and French, but not for us and the Indians." The smith forgot the bellows. "Just the other day, we hear word that Jim Walker just escaped the savages. He made the mistake of straying too far from Fort Loudon when the bastards shot his horse and mounted it saddle on him. Had he not the knife on him, he'd have been a gonner. Heard that, did ye?"

Ephraim shook his head.

"Aye. They got him back to the Indian settlement when he was left with two of them. He fetchs his knife when they were both asleep." The smith pantomimed cutting tied wrists. "Just like that, he's free. One of the bastards woke and they scuffled. He grabs the savage by the hair and plunged the knife into his throat." The smith enjoyed acting out the fight. "He said the other fellow woke when he heard his friend killed, but was so scared that he ran off. Mr. Walker only two weeks ago emerged from the wilderness back to Fort Loudon. So, I don't think the settlers will be back as soon as you think."

"Where's Fort Loudon?"

The smith motions over Ephraim's shoulder. "Off that way about a day's ride."

Ephraim concluded "that way" was further to the West. "When were they last here?"

"A few years. We haven't but one in ten that we had here when the war started. Ben plans to lay out a proper town at some point. Maybe then---"

"Then you need help."

The smith sighed. "When there's a town, yes. But that won't be for years."

"I need the work. Not for wages. Just to get on my feet and head down the road."

"To Fort Pitt?"

"No, down to Virginia, perhaps."

"Aye, perhaps. What's in Virginia?"

"My business."

"But, you're a dandy. I mean, look at you."

Ephraim looked down at his suit.

"No way you're working in that. You've not worked a rough day in your life."

"My father was a smith, I'll have you know. I 'prentised under him." He made a point of changing his accent a bit. He tried to sound rougher. "I can work the bellows. I can do most of the work you would expect if you had a 'prentise. You're doing work you oughtn't do if you're the master smith. I can't do much about the suit."

The smith considered Ephraim for a few moments. "Go on. Let me see your hands."

Ephraim held his hands out.

The smith grabbed the hand, and turned it palm up and back to palm down. "Not a dandy's hands. I'll give you that. Not quite rough, but not danty."

"As I said, I 'prentised under my father. He wanted something better of me and my brother. Don't let my attire deceive you. I can do just about everything you need."

"Everything, eh? We'll see about that. It would do to have a lighter load. I'll try you on and see if this works out. But, if you've not proved your metal by week's end, away with ya."

Ephraim noted the bite in the smith's warning. He thought back to the hot, sweaty days as a young boy. It just occurred to him that he may not be in the best shape to swing a hammer. He had to try. "There's something more?"

"Aye?"

"I'll need some place to stay." He lifted his bag. "All that I have is here."

"Och. There it is. Did you think that didn't occur to me, lad? Here I thought you've lived here in Falling Springs me whole life and I just now laid eyes on you. You're a daft one that." He motioned toward a ladder at the back of the shop, then pointed up. "There's the loft, for services rendered. But, until then, get this fire going again. I'm going for a piss."
