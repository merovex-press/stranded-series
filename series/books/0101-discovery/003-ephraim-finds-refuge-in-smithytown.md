   **Ephraim finds refuge in Smithytown.** Ephraim arrives in a nearby town at wilderness' edge (Smithytown) and asks a local smith CHESTER O'BRIEN to take him on for support (using an assumed name). The smith is grudging, but lets him do so. Later, Ephraim fixes a horse's hoof, foregoing compensation (overseen by Chester approvingly) He later catches Ephraim sleeping in the shop and takes pity by giving him a blanket, etc. They talk politics and Ephraim finds Chester is pro-Liberty.
