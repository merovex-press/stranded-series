synopsis: |
   **Ephraim thwarts Mortimer.** Ephraim and Mortimer talk about the rifle & light, with Mortimer wanting to know more. As the conversation isn't working, he has a meal in the jail with Ephraim trying to get him drunk (he is drinking tea...show the flasks being different out of Ephraim's eye line?). When Mortimer realizes Ephraim has a high alcohol tolerance, the conversation changes, but degenerates into an argument over liberty and authority. "Your sentence will be carried out." "I've not been tried yet." "You were in absentia."
