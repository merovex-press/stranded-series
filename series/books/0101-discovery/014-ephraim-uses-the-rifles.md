synopsis: |
   **Ephraim uses the rifles.** Ephraim uses the rifle and two clips of bullets to kill them. He loots the bodies, replacing the boots with shoes that fit him. He throws the boots away, hoping they are lost in the undergrowth. He picks up one of the clips, but cannot find the other. He uses the Indians' arrows to mask the wounds. He is more cautious moving forward, worried more Indians are out & about.
