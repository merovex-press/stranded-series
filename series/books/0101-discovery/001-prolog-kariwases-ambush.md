   **Prolog: Kariwase's Ambush** KARIWASE and his band stalk up on trappers sleeping, and capture them. Bewildered, the lead trapper speaks in French, until Kariwase points out the English accent. Kariwase observes how the French & Indian war started, then does the same to the trapper to the excitement of his men.
