synopsis: |
   **Ephraim discovers technology.** Ephraim regains consciousness. He is cut all over from falling down the pit. His leg hurts, but is unbroken. He has a little bit of light from the hole, which lets him find enough material to start a small fire. With the fire, he is able to expand his scope and light a torch, and build a larger fire. He realizes he cannot climb back up the hole as there is a bit of a ceiling; nor does he want to. While he explores the chamber he is in, he sees a clothed skeleton on a throne with a staff & BOOTS. He strips the boots, causing the rifle to fall over and discharge a round. This terrifies him until he realizes the staff is a RIFLE. He takes it in hand and fires it twice. He slings it, and uses the torch to explore. While exploring, he enters a lit room, which leads him to two LANTERNs. Using the Lantern, he explores further, finding a warehouse of rifles, bullets, etc. Garand thumb. He sleeps. The boots are tight, but he needs something.
