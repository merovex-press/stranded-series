   **Heading to the temple.** As they head out into the wilderness, Ephraim tries to obfuscate the route, but the first night of camping Daniel Strand (surveyor) tells his brother Andrew (Smith & Tinkerer) that he has been marking the route while masking it from Indians. They arrive at the ground entrance. Once inside, Ephraim uses the other light to lead them to the warehouse. Fewer than 100. They select & hastily clean the rifles, secure ammunition. One of the team discovers the boots and decides to wear them; leading to several others donning the finely-made boots.
