    **Dorian heads to Philadelphia.** Dorian emerges back to Smithytown and has MOOK-1 & MOOK-3 remain in case Ephraim survives; he is convinced he is dead but errs on the side of caution. He then starts the trip back to Philadelphia with MOOK-4. Mook-1 & -3 agree to alternate who sleeps in the loft and who sleeps in the widow's house.
