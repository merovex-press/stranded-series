  synopsis: |
    **Battle of Fort Pitt.** All arrive at Ft. Pitt, and have a huge firefight, with the rifles slaughtering the Indians. Indian tactics of waiting until the muskets are fired is thwarted by the smokeless/repeating nature of the rifles. Kariwase wounded, not sure if I want him to escape.
