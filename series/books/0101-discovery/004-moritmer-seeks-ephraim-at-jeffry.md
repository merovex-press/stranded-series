synopsis: |
   **Moritmer seeks Ephraim at Jeffry.** MORTIMER REECE shows up at Jeffry's office a few weeks later, looking for Ephraim. In the ensuing conversation, Mortimer learns Ephraim is trained as a smith, not just a preacher. He doubts Jeffry's honesty, but will not confront him. Afterwards, he argues briefly with his 2nd man DORIAN MABBOTT about how to handle Jeffry; instead agreeing to focus on the goal of capturing Ephraim. They agree to send scouts to all the neighboring towns to find out whether a new smith has shown up. This yields fruit by finding JEFFRY BOYDELL, who Mortimer is persuaded is Ephraim.
