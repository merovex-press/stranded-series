   **Jeffry negotiates a solution.** Jeffry arrives in Philadelphia, and meets with Ephraim. He then meets with Mortimer, where he learns about the rifle & lantern. He tries to use the exchange of information for clemency, and rails against the "in absentianess" of the charge. "Not befitting a proper Englishman." Mortimer says he will recommend a new trial if Ephraim comes clean.
