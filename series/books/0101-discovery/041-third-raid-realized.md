    **Third raid realized.** The next day, Ephraim is given a team of 12, a mix of veterans and novices; including the STRAND BROTHERS (ANDREW & DANIEL). While Mortimer go with a proper Redcoat regiment, Ephraim & Dorsey start off for Smithytown. While en route, they happen upon a THIRDTOWN that had been devastated. Dorsey has to talk Ephraim out of going to Jeffrytown "They will be taken or dead. Steel yourself, man."
