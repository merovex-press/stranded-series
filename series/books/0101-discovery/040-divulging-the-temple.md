   **Divulging the Temple.** Over dinner with Mortimer, Dorsey & Jeffry, Ephraim says there are more, "scores, maybe even hundreds." As they talk location, fear strikes Mortimer & Dorsey as they realize this trove is in the Wilderness. "If the savages get these, we will be put out of the Americas." He doesn't want to surrender the location to the English, but realizing the need agrees to take a team to the site to secure more rifles.
