    **Ephraim falls into the Temple.** Resting, Ephraim overhears the Indians, and continues to flee. They finally are able to see him on a mound and open fire. He runs like a rabbit, and falls into a hole. The Indians start to climb, when one observes it's an old haunted mound; they beat a retreat.
