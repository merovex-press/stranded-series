   **Ephraim escapes Ambush.** During the ensuing fight, Ephraim finds an opening in a large hollowed log that he crawls through. This lets him get outside Dorian's containment. As the fight shifts, he is able to emerge again after the Indians have passed, allowing him to escape their containment. He is shoeless, but able to disappear.
