   **Ephraim captured by Dorian.** Ephraim steals a horse and gallops away, under pursuit. The race goes until night, with Ephraim fretful that he escaped. He headed into the wilderness. He lets the horse go, hoping it will distract Dorian's team. Hearing their hushed voices, he realizes the hunt is not over. Through the night, he continues to evade Dorian's men. Thinking he is safe, he falls asleep, only to awake with Dorian & his nine (9) men surrounding him.
