Ephraim killed a British officer and was found guilty, only to escape and flee to the edge of society seeking refuge with his brother. Jeffry refuses, but also gives him lead time to flee into the wilderness, where Ephraim is pursued by Indians and falls into the Temple. With advanced weapons in hand, he tries to get them to Sons of Liberty, only to be captured by Mortimer. When Pontiac's Rebellion is known, he relents to his brother's pressure to surrender the location of the temple (and take Mortimer & militia there) to get more weapons to lift the seige of Ft. Pitt. In compensation, Mortimer lets Ephraim free by agreeing to say he was killed in the fighting. Ephraim decides to go to South  Carolina under an assumed name, but murders & robs Solomon Sharpe first.
