# Tips

* A-Story is the Lie - rescuing a skyscraper from terrorists
* B-Story is the emotional layer - because his wife is in the skyscraper
* C-Story is the Truth the hero embraces / the Change - set duty aside for wife (move to LA)

* A-Story - the primary drive of the series, the franchise (Castle as author who solves crime)
* B-Story - the emotional element (Castle as family man)


Each Season should have a Central Question; or in the alternative a Thematic one.

You'll have to create a family of sorts. Start with the family in the homeworld (Ard); create one in the first season in the new world.

## Family

* Patriarch
* Matriarch
* uncles / aunts
* sons / daughters
* siblings

* Home family
* working family
* strangers as family

## Parts of a Story

Sketch these beats always for each of the three stories above:
1. the ordinary life of the character
2. the inciting incident;
3. the end of act one â€“ goal and plan;
4. the midpoint wherein the story goes off in a new direction and your character develops a more important goal;
5. the low, or all is lost, point;
6. the final challenge wherein your protagonist defeats his antagonist;
7. the return to the now forever changed ordinary life.

## Villain
* Write the A-Story from his point-of-view
* When writing about the villain, rather than point out his flaw point out the quality that makes him human to take away his being two dimensional.
