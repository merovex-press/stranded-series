## Concept

**Show Cross**
<!-- Coming two to three shows to form your “show cross”. Try taking one project considered a “classic”, one you draw your own inspiration from, and then one current hit. -->
1. [Grizzly Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Times_of_Grizzly_Adams) - a man who is forced out on his own and wants to return home.
2. [Macgyver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver) - a man who is able to solve problems with ingenuity
3. ...

### Logline

A homesick slipstream scientist watches an alien society from space. When his orbital is attacked, he is forced to abandon ship and finds himself strand on the planet's surface.

<!-- Write a short and powerful description of the core concept. Two sentences is ideal. A logline for a scripted series will often describe the main character's plight and unique circumstance that drives the story.  -->

### Synopsis

<!-- Write an overview of the series idea, describing the world or setting it takes place in, the unique conflicts faced, and the dynamics between main characters that fuel the story. This is a great sales tool because you're going to highlight the most interesting facets and themes of the series. You should be able to do this in three paragraphs, but a few pages is ok so long as the writing is "tight" and reads efficiently, moving the story beat by beat. -->

In the 18th century, humanity discovered advanced alien technology in the Toltec Indian mounds. Over the next 150 years, society embraces the technology and develops interstellar travel via the slipstream, all while retaining paranoid nationalism. When they encounter other human settlements on alien worlds, they chose to study them out of concern that "alien" use of slipstream technology puts them at risk.

### Theme

Duty. Honor. Country.

## Characters

<!-- Describe you main protagonist and other key characters in the series. Write less about their background and more about their current circumstances and shared conflict. A short paragraph for each is ideal. Clarify how they view their world, and how they relate to others. Create irony with their behavior. Find the flaw in a hero, and a redeeming quality in an antagonist.  -->

**Albert Harred, protagonist** is the descendent of one of the Slipstream discoverers. His drive to honor the family legacy leads him to turn his back on his new family and spend two years on a research orbital. As his tour wraps up, his orbital is attacked by anarchists, forcing him to abandon ship. The ship inexplicably navigates straight to the surface below. He crashes.

He awakes hostage on an alien world. He uses his knowledge of advanced technology to survive. He tries desperately to develop the means to return home while trying to maneuver in the real war on the alien planet. But, he must keep the alien humans from mastering the technology and awaking the real threat to his homeworld.

**Alien ruler - Country, Antagonist** wants to dominate his wee continent. He paints himself as the victim and tries to seduce Albert (whom he calls "Herbert", which is a play on words) to support him with newfangled weapons. He wants a doomsday weapon. He is "Country."

**Alien scientist - Duty** works for AR. He's assigned to help with the doomsday weapon and steal ideas from Albert. His fanatical dedication to AR is slowly eroded by his interaction with Albert. He decides (or pretends to) help Albert get home. He is "Duty."

**Alien princess - Honor** is AR's daughter. She falls in love with Albert and wants him to fall in love with her. She is "Honor."

Contrast this with Albert's homeworld:

**Albert's Father - Country** wants to keep his domination of industry. When his son is reported missing, he is split between serving his company and saving his son who is probably dead. "I have another."

**Albert's "best" Friend - Duty** was with him when they were attacked, and helped Albert escape. We learn early on this was a ruse to get rid of Albert so that his friend could go after the widow...

**Albert's true best Friend - Duty** with him before being sent home. He is the action between the Father & Wife...while the Father comes to want his son home, he can't do the work.

**Albert's wife & Family - Honor** she is heartbroken when he left, and mourns when she finds him reported missing. She is suspicious of the best friend, especially after he clearly makes advances to him. She is the steel that pushes Father to do something, and develops to be a force to be reckoned with.

<!-- * **Central Character** - This is where we’re really going to get to know your main character. Even if this is an ensemble, dive deep into at least one principle character. Attach some images of a popular star who fits the type. An actor you think is both interesting to executives, but who’s personality and type conveys the character you have in mind. Consider images that maybe show wardrobe design. This is fun, think of it like casting your project. Then go into detail on who this person is. Include a few important defining moments from their backstory. What brings them to the story the pilot will tell. What will happen to them? What inner conflict will they struggle with? What positive qualities make them great? What flaws might be their downfall.
* **Antagonist**  An antagonist could be the source of the conflict our main character will need to face. A broad villain type works in certain types of action adventure dramas. It could also be someone who seems good on the outside but is manipulating situations. Many popular shows play with the idea of who the villains and heroes are by blurring the lines, and upending expectations. Throw in some specifics about this character and his or her back story. In what ways will he challenge the lead? How will he help him to grow? Might they work together at some point? Will they ever come into direct conflict? -->

## Setting

* World

This is an alt-history where "alien" technology was discovered in the 18th Century. This kept America and Britain unified, led to significant achievements technologically, and questions about the order of things.

<!-- * What type of music is popular in this universe you created? Or fashion? What’s happening in the background of your key locations?
* What are the politics of the police force this show centers on? Any pertinent history?
* Include any and all specifics about your world that you absolutely love and help convey the depth of your knowledge of your universe. Go as deep as you like as long as it feels somehow pertinent to the stories you will be telling.
* Paint a picture of the world we are going to visit each week in a way that makes us curious to know more about it, and to keep coming back. -->

## Create a Mood Board

Including something like a Moodboard in your Show Bible can allow you to go even further when defining the tone of your project. Give us a look at the world, on an even broader canvas. Think of it as a chance to fully create the world your show takes place in. With no budget.

## Style / Tone

The tone section should include a visual style you wish to emulate or emphasize. Reference projects and styles you find inspiring.

Discuss any rules that you think should govern the tone of this series to make it unique: “Everything will be handheld to give the show a raw, lived in feeling, despite the glossy sci-fi production design.”

Create juxtapositions between your concept and your “look” that make your show dynamic.
What type of score will you use? Somber? Electronic? Does the show have a generally negative outlook? Positive? How should that manifest in each plot? These are instructions for future writers as well as executives.

### How people interact

### Dialog

### Format

* Each season comprises eight episodes.
* Each episode is 26,500±2,500 words or 80±8 pages in length, split into 8 segments.
* Write the entire first season, then drop the first four as single novellas and one bundle. Then drop the next novel every six weeks, which buys you six months.
* Each season should model a Biblical theme story (e.g. Gideon, David)

<!-- The average read-time for an episode in this series is 120 minutes @ 220wpm ± 10% (26,500±2,500 words or 80±8 pages).
This is 212 Audible minutes @ 125wpm or 3.5 hours.

This is 212,000 words (191 to 233 @ ± 10%), equivalent to three novels ~71Kw (64 - 78).
-->

## Pilot

Teaser - 2-3 pages sometimes called the “cold open”. Show us a character, often the main character, and tease some sort of conflict. Try ending on a cliffhanger. Ask the questions the episode will attempt to answer.
* First scene "what do you miss most," asked by his nemesis..."motorcycle." This leads to an argument between the two friends and Albert who think it should be his wife. Need to show this is Edwardian era (1911).

Act one - Give us a bit more on the main characters for this episode. If the teaser was a crime, then act one is the crime scene investigation. Ramp up the tension through the act and bring us to another cliffhanger.

Act two - Similar to the second act in a movie, this is the act where the character will be to struggle with the conflict head on. This should feel like an uphill battle, but with emerging hope. At the end of the act begin to flip expectations.

Act three - Things have derailed and we’re in a low point for our character. Joseph Campbell calls this “the belly of the beast”. Our character is defeated, and trapped. But our audience will stay tuned in to see if there is any hope of survival, or what fate the character will suffer.

Act four - Against all odds, our character will prevail. What did he/she learn from what happened in acts one and two? What mistakes were made? What lesson has become available to them? What inner resolve have the drawn from? They apply this to the conflict at hand and resolve it.

Act five- Often this is a wrap up. Provide some additional closure, and perhaps tease out where the story will go next- in future episodes. What future conflict is still to come? How was today’s “win” just one battle in what looks more like it may be a war?


## Series Outline

Write a list of 8 episode descriptions, similar to a Logline for each, so we quickly understand the content of each proposed episode, and can see an arc of story over the course of a season.

### Season One

One-sentence logline of the A-story. One sentence logline of the B-Story. A-story is always the episode problem. B-story is always the central conflict (duty, honor, country - Loyalty).

In Jack Ryan, the B-Story was about his struggle between being a Boy Scout and delivering on mission. By the end of the first season, Ryan did the mission thing, which was shoot the target with disregard of the crowd.

* **EPISODE 1: “DISCOVERY”** Gleason investigates a violent murder in on of New Tyrelle’s poorer districts. His son Max struggles to make friends and can’t get adjusted to their new life.
