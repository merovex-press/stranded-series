\f1\b0\fs22 \cf0 Stories were first told for two reasons: entertainment and education. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The Epic of Gilgamesh}} was the story of a hero who kicked ass and took names, but it was also a celebration of the culture that produced it, one of the first.\
Different from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 An Aesop}} in that the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Central Theme}} is often a question or a general topic rather than a direct precept or conclusion: where an Aesop is a specific moral that is explicated and forced on the audience, a Central Theme will more likely be explored, analyzed, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Played With}}. For example, \'93{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The Power of Friendship}}\'94 or (even better) \'93The struggles of sustaining The Power of Friendship {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 in a cold, harsh world}}\'94 are themes in that they are questions or issues that the author is interested in exploring and/or wants the reader to think about, whereas \'93The Power of Friendship will ultimately overcome all obstacles\'94 is an Aesop in that it is a lesson or conclusion the author wants the reader to take away from the work. Of course, there can be a fine line between them, and the central theme can and often is used to develop and deliver the Aesop, but they are not strictly speaking the same.\
Using our example above as a demonstration, the writer may have constructed a story that examines the difficulties of sustaining The Power of Friendship in a cold, harsh world (theme), only to ultimately reach the conclusion that The Power of Friendship will always prevail (Aesop). The reader may disagree with the author\'92s conclusion, but regardless, the work will still be about the difficulties of sustaining The Power of Friendship, and there\'92s nothing the reader can do to change that.\
Put simply, the Aesop is the what the author wants the reader to 
\f2\i learn
\f1\i0 . The Central Theme is what the story is fundamentally 
\f2\i about
\f1\i0 .\
Also compare {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Motif"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Motif}}, a more general term for a recurring {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Symbolism"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 symbol}} or idea throughout a work, different from Central Theme in that it is not the story\'92s main focus. Another distinction is that a Central Theme is 
\f2\i usually
\f1\i0  a broad, expansive topic\'97love, time, mortality\'97while Motifs are generally smaller and more specific.\
A good place to start thinking about the theme of the work is the conflict it depicts; what is the overall conflict of the story, where does it originate, and what questions or thinking points does this conflict prompt?\
Go to a work\'92s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Analysis"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Analysis}} sub-page to find a more detailed exploration of its central theme \'97 or add your own insight. As always, however, be wary of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotDidactic"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 seeing messages where there are none}}.}
