Ephraim arrives in Philadelphia and quietly makes himself known to the Sons. After a meal, he arranges a rural demonstration of the rifles, but SOLOMON SHARPE reports this to WARREN BOYDELL, who sends word to Mortimer.
Meanwhile, Kariwase meets with Pontiac and receives instructions related to the brewing war.
Mortimer meets with Jeffry and is flustered, accusing him of harboring a fugitive (and of being a coward by not challenging a duel), but when he gets back to his room in the Inn has word from Boydell of Ephraim's location. He hurries back to Philadelphia.
In Philadelphia, Boydell traps Ephraim by having Sharpe entertain Ephraim over dinner.
Meanwhile, Kariwase is involved in a battle fought before Ft. Pitt Siege.
