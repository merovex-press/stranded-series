### Decade Dissonance

A large-scale form of [Schizo Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech).

Every country is different thanks to culture and geography, and no two cities in any one country are alike either. However some worlds can take this to extremes, making two side by side cities as different as night and day. The differences can be purely cosmetic or go all the way to lifestyle, architecture, and even technology. You can have a [Utopia](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia) city made of [Crystal Spires and Togas](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas) sitting smack dab next to a ghetto...sorry, "quaint hamlet" that [never left](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis) [The Middle Ages](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges).

The reason, if any is given, is that there's no technology trade between the countries, so any discoveries a country makes (from Agriculture to Zoology) never leave it. Other times it's a question of societal values, where the "savage" village has chosen not to develop technology in favor of peaceful agrarian lives; however you can expect them to have copious and advanced magic if it's a [Magic Versus Science](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience) setting. It's almost never purely stylistic, like [Gotham City](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman) and [Metropolis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman). Both exist in the same year and country, but one is firmly entrenched in 1920's Gothic and Noir style, while the other is an Art Deco optimistic future.

More plausible is [Used Future](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture), where one area is able to maintain a relative level of sophistication [After](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd) or [Just Before the End](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBeforeTheEnd) where others are reduced to tent villages. In these cases, advanced technology is *known of* by most, but becomes uncommon away from the advanced areas.

See also: [Crystal Spires and Togas](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas), [Advanced Ancient Acropolis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientAcropolis) and [Ludd Was Right](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight). Compare [Low Culture, High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech), where a backwards culture uses technology it doesn't understand. Possibly also a [Tomorrowland](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomorrowland).
