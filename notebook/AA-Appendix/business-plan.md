### Audience / Customer Segments

<!-- Who are the customers? What do they think? See? Feel? Do? -->

Stranded readers come from a wide background. They like history, are skeptical, but accept diverse values and opinions while retaining their own. They like to wonder what would happen if a few things in the past turned out differently.

1. **White-collar travelers.** Some Stranded readers commute, so they want to have short bursts of entertainment that fits in the time spent waiting in the airport or in the air.
2. **Super-Commuters.** Some Stranded readers spend 2 hours a day on commuting. Like white-collar travelers, they are looking for entertainment that fits their travel time.
2. **Blue-collar truckers.** Some Stranded readers are on the road for work. These are truckers who are looking for something to keep them from getting bored for longer periods.

### Genres

Stranded is an Alternate/Alternative History genre series. The Genre Research table below shows there are three genre keyword paths that all point to the same best-seller list. Stranded is a political thriller (set against the backdrop of a political power struggle. They usually involve various extra-legal plots, designed to give political power to someone, while his opponents try to stop him. Political corruption, terrorism, and warfare are common themes).

### Value Proposition / Business Model

What’s compelling about the proposition? Why do customers buy, use?

Stranded provides uplifting serial fiction novellas to satisfy our customer segments' desire for entertainment. Each novella should be short enough to fit in the time a reader / listener is either at the airport, in the air, or in the car. Novellas seasons are long enough to fill a long-hauler's driving week. Being short, we are not competing heavily for their time with other entertainment options. We fill the gap.

Our Author business model is "solo-developed high-volume fiction." We seek to put out a new 10-book season every two years to start, launching a new book very 2 months. In a perfect world (full-time writing), a new season would launch every year with books released monthly. In both cases, there is time for two months off.

We are not distracting ourselves with other value propositions, such as speaking, consulting, or other business options like helping other writers.

Customer Relationships: How do you interact with the customer through their journey?

Merovex focuses on maintaining its audience primarily through the Newsletter as this is the only forum where the author has direct access to the list. We leverage Facebook, Reddit and YouTube to connect with the audience member, hoping they will register their email for the newsletter.

### Revenue Streams

Revenue Streams: How does the business earn revenue from the value propositions?

- **eBook.** At $2.99, a season costs the reader $29.99 and makes the author $20.93 (70%).
- **Printed.** A printed season should also cost $30 as it comprises the equivalent of 3 novels ($29.88)
- **Audiobook.** Sell [Audible](https://www.acx.com/help/what-s-the-deal/200497690) at the season, making $3 per sale, $6 if I record it myself.

Stranded does not engage in subscription content services. I do not want to monetize the direct relationship between author and audience so that I can focus on them as people and not dollar signs.
