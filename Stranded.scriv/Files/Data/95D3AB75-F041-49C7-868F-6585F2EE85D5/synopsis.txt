In a cell (Research jails in Philadelphia circa 1770), Ephraim sends word to Jeffry asking for help.
Mortimer arrives in Philadelphia and after meeting with Sharp wants to find out about the weapon. They secure the rifle and test it, with Mortimer having a thumb incident.
Ephraim and Mortimer talk about the rifle, and Mortimer tries to get him drunk, only to learn that Ephraim has a high alcohol tolerance. They argue about British authority instead. "Your sentence will be carried out." "I've not been tried yet." "You were in absentia."
Meanwhile, Kariwase involved in another attack somewhere, and we find that he is up-and-coming and very anti-European.
Jeffry arrives in Philadelphia and tries to find a way to help his brother; finding out that Mortimer might let Ephraim free if the Temple's location was revealed. But, Ephraim refuses to help the British.
Meanwhile, news of Pontiac's raids reach Philadelphia, alerting to the need to take action. LOCAL COMMANDER realizes there are insufficient troops to protect the interior, when Boydell mentions the weapons.
This renews pressure to divulge the location, and when confronted about the facts (which he wants to doubt but for Jeffry's fear), Ephraim surrenders the weapon cache's location.
