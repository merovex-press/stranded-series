### America is Still a Colony\
\
If there was a failed revolution, then it's quite likely that the colonies will have suffered some sort of harsh reprisals, and may still be living under some sort of [stern martial law](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppressiveStatesOfAmerica). In this case, expect to find [La R\'e9sistance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance) going strong.\
\
The colonists will often retain stereotypically British traits, such as accentsnote , even though those traits were not actually affected by the war, but by distance, and, in many cases, were already somewhat established by the time the war occurred. This may be done to help remind the viewer that things are different in this timeline, or it may simply be [Rule of Funny](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny).\
\
In any case, expect mention of [Historical Domain Characters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter) like [George Washington](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington), [Thomas Jefferson](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson), and [Benjamin Franklin](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin), in much different roles from the ones they played in our history. They may be branded as traitors, or simply remembered for much different things.note  Benedict Arnold's name will no longer be a synonym for [Turncoat](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Turncoat), and may even be a term of praise. Paul Revere will be remembered for his work as a silversmith, rather than for the midnight ride immortalized by the poet Longfellow.\

[Sub-Trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope) of [Different States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentStatesOfAmerica).\

See also the [Divided States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica), where the US never unified or the union broke up at some point; the [Fallen States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenStatesOfAmerica), where the US has become a third world country; the [Invaded States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvadedStatesOfAmerica), where the US has either been invaded or outright conquered; and the [Expanded States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedStatesOfAmerica), where the US has gotten bigger.\
