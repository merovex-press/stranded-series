He explores the temple, finding the lantern, then weapons, then massive trove.

He finds a way out of the Temple, but the pursuit resumes when he gives away his position.

He shoots the hunting party killing the five of them in rapid succession. Rather than run, he loots the bodies for shoes and uses their arrows to conceal the wounds.

With a makeshift sled, he pulls out his samples and heads to Philadelphia, but he stops by his place in Smithytown, which alerts Mortimer that he is not dead.

Meanwhile, Kariwase discovers the slain warrior party and discovers the ruse, bewildered he tracks Mortimer's sled until he realizes it is leaving their territory.

Mortimer, alerted to Ephraim's return confronts the Smithy, but is thwarted somehow, and has his men resume searching neighboring towns while he goes back to Jeffry.
