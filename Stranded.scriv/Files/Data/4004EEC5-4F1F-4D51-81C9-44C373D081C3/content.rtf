\f0\fs28 \cf0 #### New England\
\
The colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Hampshire were consolidated into the Province of New England. This included all land South of the St. Lawrence, which extends to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and parts of Quebec. All land east of the Hudson becomes New England as well, except for Manhattan and Long Island. This led to considerable resistance by the Sons of Liberty, and led a small rebellion put down by Virginia and Pennsylvania.\
