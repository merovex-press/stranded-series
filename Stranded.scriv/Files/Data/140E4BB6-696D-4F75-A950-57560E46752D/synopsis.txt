Ephraim reacts to having given away the best thing for the Revolution when his brother cheers him up (story less). They start training on the weapons they have when they realize they do not have enough (4 rifles) or enough bullets (80). Mortimer heads to Pitt while Ephraim takes a small team to the Temple to get more, including the Strand brothers. He tries to take a route to obfuscate the temple's location. They get to the temple, no sign of trouble, get more weapons and bullets, and head to Pitt. Meanwhile, the Seige at Pitt intensifies. Mortimer and his men get into a fight with Kariwase, who is beaten back by the four rifles. Stunned & wounded, Kariwase heads to Pitt with Mortimer in pursuit. All arrive at Pitt and a fight ensues with two teams with rifles putting the indians into a cross-fire that kills most the indians.
