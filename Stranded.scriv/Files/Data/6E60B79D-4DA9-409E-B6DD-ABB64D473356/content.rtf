\f1\b0\fs22 \cf0 If there was a failed revolution, then it\'92s quite likely that the colonies will have suffered some sort of harsh reprisals, and may still be living under some sort of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppressiveStatesOfAmerica"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 stern martial law}}. In this case, expect to find {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 La R\'e9sistance}} going strong.\
The colonists will often retain stereotypically British traits, such as accentsnote , even though those traits were not actually affected by the war, but by distance, and, in many cases, were already somewhat established by the time the war occurred. This may be done to help remind the viewer that things are different in this timeline, or it may simply be {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Rule of Funny}}.\

They may be branded as traitors, or simply remembered for much different things.note Benedict Arnold\'92s name will no longer be a synonym for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Turncoat"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Turncoat}}, and may even be a term of praise. Paul Revere will be remembered for his work as a silversmith, rather than for the midnight ride immortalized by the poet Longfellow.\
