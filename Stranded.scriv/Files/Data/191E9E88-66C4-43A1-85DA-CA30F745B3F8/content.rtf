\f1\b0\fs22 \cf0 When life gives you lemons\'85note\
The world is filled with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Wide Eyed Idealists}} who believe in truth and justice and devote their lives to fighting for it. And then the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 dark, cruel and brutal world}} keeps letting them down. For them, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Being Good Sucks}}. But rather than giving up on their goals, they choose to fight not because they believe they will truly make a difference, but because it\'92s the right thing to do.\
More often than not these characters are in settings that feature {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Black and Gray Morality}}. They\'92re usually {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 survivors}} who have largely given up on believing in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Honor Before Reason}}, but still strive to be {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Lawful Good}} or as close to it as reality allows them to be. They are willing to bend the rules to save them. In {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Lighter and Softer}} settings, these characters are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Grumpy Bears}} and are often mocked by the other characters for being so sour all the time.\
The presence of cynicism usually makes the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIdealist"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 idealistic behavior even more noteworthy}}: it\'92s easy to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 love everyone}} when {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Rousseau Was Right}}, but you really have to be a good guy to believe that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Humans Are Bastards}} and care about them anyway. Such characters can also be {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The Fettered}}; their cynical outlook tells them they could probably get away with all kinds of things that they don\'92t do because {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 that would be wrong}}, and just because the world sucks doesn\'92t mean you need to make it worse. Then again, this kind of character goes great with a world where you {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Earn Your Happy Ending}} after much strife.\
This is the inverse of the worldview of most {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Well Intentioned Extremists}}, especially those who believe that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Utopia Justifies the Means}}. Extremists or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Knight Templars}} may 
\f2\i believe
\f1\i0  themselves to be this, but their actions are far too extreme. A Knight In Sour Armor believes in the rules and breaks them only when absolutely necessary, which is very rarely; not surprisingly, many have taken a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicVow"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Heroic Vow}} related to this behavior. Often has a personal set of rules, trimmed down to those that really 
\f2\i matter
\f1\i0  in order to minimize conflicts and distractions. Contributes to the Knight\'92s gruff tendencies, since politeness tends to appear a lot further down the priority list than feeding orphans and so on.\
Generally, these characters fit one of two personality types. Members of the first type are former {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Wide Eyed Idealists}} who have come to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 accept}} that their world is on the low end of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Sliding Scale of Idealism vs.\'a0Cynicism}}, but who {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIdealist"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 still find something beautiful in their former ideals}} that they want to hold on to. Those of the second type are born cynics, who would make natural {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Jerkass}} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 antiheroes}}, but who nevertheless have devoted themselves to a code of honor or fair play. In either case, these people tend to have gone through (often painful) {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Character Development}} in their past, meaning that they are normally older than the average hero.\
Either way, however, the effect is basically the same: you have a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Knight in Shining Armor}} wearing {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Jade-Colored Glasses}}; the difference between the first and second types is which comes first.\
These characters show up often in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Film Noir}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFantasy"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Dark Fantasy}}, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Low Fantasy}}. Law enforcement is a particularly attractive career, but the Knight in Sour Armor will usually hold back from becoming a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Cowboy Cop}}. Very frequently, they end up as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The Mentor}}, a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyBear"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Grumpy Bear}} with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Jade-Colored Glasses}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The Last DJ}}, or a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Cool Old Guy}} if they last long enough. As teammates, they are often the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SourSupporter"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Sour Supporter}}. They also frequently end up as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Hero Antagonists}} and extreme {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Woobies}}. This is often the final state of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The Atoner}} post-{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Heel\'96Face Turn}}. Despite their cynicism, they behave like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiNihilist"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The Anti-Nihilist}}.\
Will often overlap with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnarkKnight"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The Snark Knight}}. Compare {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Angst? What Angst?}}, for characters who take the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 troubles of a good alignment}} with far less complaint; {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Noble Demon}}, who will {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 proudly declare themselves evil}}, but still finds themselves doing good once in a while; {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SourOutsideSadInside"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Sour Outside, Sad Inside}}, for characters who sour attitude hides the fact they\'92re sad; and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Jerkass Woobie}}, who spits in the face of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 alignment}} chart. Converted {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyRabbitIdealismIsForKids"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Silly Rabbit, Idealism Is for Kids!}} or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsOldFashioned"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Good Is Old-Fashioned}} believers may well find themselves becoming this trope if the heroes can bring them around. If they don\'92t like idealism, but don\'92t like cynicism, either, then you also have a touch of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyRabbitCynicismIsForLosers"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers!}}\

Every part of that applies to me, too. I\'92m not setting myself above them on any level. But at the end of the day, sometimes humanity isn\'92t so bad. Lisa: Sometimes. Took me a while to realize that. The more you find out, the uglier things tend to look. But you keep looking, and it\'92s not all bad at the end. \'97 Worm\
Woman in alley: Thank you! Thank you! That thing was going to kill me! Spike: Well, what did you expect? Out alone in this neighborhood > \'97 I\'92ve got half a mind to kill you myself, you half-wit. Woman in alley: What? Spike: I mean honestly, what kind of retard wears heels like that in a dark alley? Take two steps and break your bloody ankle. Woman in alley: [annoyed] I was just trying to get home. Spike: Well, get a cab, you moron, and on the way, if a stranger offers you candy, don\'92t get in the van! \'97 Angel, \'93Soul Purpose\'94\
Jon Snow: I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. Now, I\'92m back. Why? Davos Seaworth: \'85I don\'92t know. Maybe we\'92ll never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can. Jon Snow: I don\'92t know how to do that. I thought I did\'85but I failed. Davos Seaworth: Good. Now go fail again. \'97 Game of Thrones, \'93Oathbreaker\'94\
John McClane: You know what you get for being a hero? Nothin\'92. You get shot at. You get a little pat on the back, blah, blah, blah, \'92attaboy! You get divorced. Your wife can\'92t remember your last name. Your kids don\'92t want to talk to you. You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself. Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy. Matt Farrell: Then why you doing this? John McClane: Because there\'92s nobody else to do it right now, that\'92s why. Believe me, if there were somebody else to do it, I\'92d let them do it, but there\'92s not. So we\'92re doing it. \'97Live Free or Die Hard\
Liara: So tell me, Shepard, what are you fighting for? Shepard: I guess I\'92m fighting for us. All of us. Liara: That\'92s a pretty big responsibility. Shepard: People are messy, awkward, sometimes selfish and cruel. But they\'92re trying, and I\'92m going to make sure they have a chance. \'97Mass Effect 2\
I\'92m no hero. Never was, never will be. Just an old killer, hired to do some wet-work. \'97 Solid Snake, Metal Gear Solid\
Do not be deceived, Wormwood. [Satan\'92s] cause is never more in danger, than when a human, no longer desiring, but intending, to do our Enemy [God]\'92s will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys. \'97 The Demon Screwtape, The Screwtape Letters\
The future is an inherently good thing. And we move into it one winter at a time. Things get better one winter at a time. If you\'92re going to celebrate anything, then have a drink on this: The world is, generally and on balance, a better place to live this year than it was last year. \'97 Spider Jerusalem, Transmetropolitan\
Hey! Mother Theresa! I was gonna do it anyway. I just hate being lectured. \'97 Gene Ryack, Air America\
Marston: Escuella was always a torn man. A cynic who desperately wanted to be a romantic. Abraham: Whereas you, John, are a romantic who wants to be a cynic. \'97 Red Dead Redemption\
Arthur: I did build a stronghold. Kaamelott, they call it. I sought and hired knights in the whole kingdom; in Caledonia, in Carmelid, in Gaunes, in Vannes, in Wales; I ordered a big table, to have the knights sitting together; I ordered it round, to prevent having a knight sitting in a corner, or at the end of it; it was complicated, so I tried to explain what was the Grail, to make sure everyone understand; it was hard, so I tried to laugh, to make sure nobody got bored; I failed; but I don\'92t want anyone to say that I did nothing. Because it\'92s not true. \'97 Kaamelott\
Renate: A Knight in Shining Armor did nothing for nobody. He never fought. A knight in dented, scraped armor, now that\'92s what you want. \'97 Nancy Drew: The Haunting of Castle Malloy\
Nicodemus: Such as why you chose this kind of life for yourself. To appoint yourself protector of mortal kind, and to make yourself the enemy of any who would do them harm. To live outcast from your own kind, laughed at and mocked by most mortals. Living in a hovel, barely scraping by. Spurning wealth and fame. Why do you do it? Harry Dresden: I\'92m a disciple of the Tao of Peter Parker, obviously. \'97 The Dresden Files: Death Masks\
Tough cop, whore from the slums, true love> \'97love that overcomes a powerful curse. A fairy tale\'85 In a world dominated by scorn and meanness, a world full of bandits and murderers, true love can > still work wonders. Lost causes are worth the struggle. A fairy tale\'85 \'97 Geralt, The Witcher\
A sword is a weapon. The art of swordsmanship is learning how to kill. That is the truth. What Miss Kaoru says is sweet and innocent talk that only those whose hands have never been stained with the blood of men can believe. But to tell you the truth, I much prefer Miss Kaoru\'92s sweet and innocent talk over the truth, that I do. \'97 Himura Kenshin, Rurouni Kenshin\
Word of advice, Ressler. This work we perform, it does not serve to look backward. This city (London), wickedness will ever leave its spores here. You and I, we are not magicians. We cannot see through walls or into men\'92s minds. Dozens perished but hundreds who were ill are now well once more. We fight. Well fight with all the skills we may muster. Beyond that, we may do no more. \'97 Edmund Reid, Ripper Street\
\'93Stop that,\'94 he says. \'93That pseudo-mysterious omnipotent voice might trick the soccer moms at the local Renaissance fair, but due to my inherent cynicism it\'92s going to take a hell of a show to convince me.\'94 \'93Oh, no,\'94 she says. \'93You, Mr.\'a0Vantas, are a fake cynic, the worst and most tragic kind.\'94 \'97 The fic look up, look up\
\'93Hey! I\'92m going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let\'92s have this out. You and me, once and for all.\'94Winning?" Is that what you think it\'92s about? I\'92m not trying to win. I\'92m not doing this because I want to beat someone, because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone. It\'92s not because it\'92s fun. God knows it\'92s not because it\'92s easy. It\'92s not even because it works because it hardly ever does. I do what I do because it\'92s right! Because it\'92s decent! And above all, it\'92s kind! It\'92s just that\'85 Just kind. If I run away today, good people will die. If I stand and fight, some of them might live. Maybe not many, maybe not for long. Hey, you know, maybe there\'92s no point to any of this at all. But it\'92s the best I can do. So I\'92m going to do it. And I\'92m going to stand here doing it until it kills me. And you\'92re going to die too! Some day\'85 And how will that be? Have you thought about it? What would you die for? Who I am is where I stand. Where I stand is where I fall. Stand with me. These people are terrified. Maybe we can help a little. Why not, just at the end, just be kind?" \'97 The Twelfth Doctor, \'93The Doctor Falls\'94\
\'93I don\'92t know any of you. But that doesn\'92t matter, does it? My family: the family you demonized and excommunicated, has fought and died through generations for this country. We do this thing\'85 for Wallachia, and her people. We don\'92t have to know you all. We do it anyway. And it\'92s not the dying that frightens us; it\'92s never having stood up and fought for you. I\'92m Trevor Belmont. Of the House of Belmont. And dying\'85 has never frightened me.\'94 \'97Trevor Belmont, Castlevania (2017)\
\'93And yeah, it\'92s a shit, shit world, but you know what? Good things are done every day. Just not, apparently, by you.\'94 \'97 Maddie Bowen, Blood Diamond\
\'93If I let everyone I thought was an idiot die, then there wouldn\'92t be very many people left, would there?\'94 \'97 Gilgamesh Wulfenbach, Girl Genius\
Harry: \'93Morgan, what the hell are you doing?\'94 Morgan: \'93My duty. I\'92ve always known that it might call for me to give up my life to protect the Council. And so it has.\'94 Harry: \'93Morgan\'85\'94 Morgan: \'93You did your best. Despite everything that has gone between us. You put yourself to the hazard again and again for my sake. It was a worthy effort. But it just wasn\'92t to be. No shame in that. You\'92ll learn, if you live long enough. You never win them all.\'94 See, here\'92s the thing. Morgan was right: you can\'92t win them all. But that doesn\'92t mean you give up. Not ever. Morgan never said that part - he was too busy living it. \'97 The Dresden Files, Turn Coat\
Judy Hopps: I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it. Chief Bogo: Don\'92t give yourself so much credit, Hopps. The world has always been broken. That\'92s why we need good cops\'85 like you. \'97Zootopia}
