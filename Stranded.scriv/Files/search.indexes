### Hobbes Was Right

*"The people, they know where I stand. They need rules to live by—I provide them. They break the rules, I break them. That's the way it works. Rights? Sure, I'm all for rights. But not at the expense of order."*

The only forces capable of controlling this setting are tyrants, dictators and authoritarian groups. Any attempt at democracy is [a doomed enterprise][WkgIb0zN], formulated by [Wide-Eyed Idealists][mbB4J6Zp] working under the belief that there is a grain of selflessness in *any* person.

That this be a *benevolent* dictatorship [is optional][b72W3BPq] (in fact, the presence of a benevolent dictator would suggest Hobbes was *wrong*).

Named after Thomas Hobbes, who wrote in the 17th-century book *Leviathan* that strong, centralized government is necessary to protect mankind from its own base nature and self-serving desires. The trope is based on a [Flanderized][7vm4GDUp] version of his philosophy. It is worth noting that many medieval kings (as an isolated example) had to be strong and bastardly to be effective. Naturally, this opinion goes hand in hand with the belief that [Humans Are Bastards][XGPRcAol], possibly [Humans Are Morons][WEnLJFHb] if the arguments are about the reliability of human judgment if power is left in the hands of the many (though when one considers who the only available candidates for rulership are—[namely, members of that same species of bastard morons][ZwyQ8TdA]…). Indeed, Rousseau—the chief defender of the contrary position—had some choice words for Hobbes (although Hobbes, being dead, couldn't appreciate the insults).

Contrast [Machiavelli Was Wrong][1JA9zHEq] and [Rousseau Was Right][3xLrhf80]; compare and contrast [The Extremist Was Right][PsuWvKwS], [The Evils of Free Will][UQJYyCIq], [Realpolitik][1QRPRXjd] and [Utopia Justifies the Means][HZr1rBiR]. Has nothing to do with *[Calvin and Hobbes][7o7VAa2T]*, though *that* Hobbes was named after this one. For Hobbes' views on the supernatural, see [Devil, but No God][TbBuDFLf] and [Burn the Witch!][63lbJCV0]

PREFACE.

Washington's Journal here given to the public, if we except his version of the "Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation," is the earliest literary effort of this, the most admirable character in all history. The editor has long been engaged in collecting accurate copies of all the obtainable writings of this great man. Wherever it has been found practicable to examine and critically compare even his generally accepted writings with the originals, it has been, or will be done to secure a copy of exact and verified conformity, in every particular, with the text as it left the hand of the writer.
It is a well-known fact that editors have taken great liberties with Washington's writings, not for the purpose of falsifying history, or aspersing his character, but from a variety of reasons, often to suppress caustic expressions, or to substitute a more euphonious word to give to his sentences a fine, rhetorical finish. Such editorial dressing, even where the motive is well intended, is vicious in principle and liable to abuse; and, in the case of Washington's writings, is neither justifiable nor desirable. The time has come when the people want to know intimately and without glamour or false coloring, the father of his country as he actually lived and labored,[6] and to possess his writings, just as he left them, on every subject which engaged his attention. It is the purpose of the editor to prepare a complete collection of all the writings of George Washington, from his youth to the close of his eventful life, with that literal exactness as to text which can only be assured by the careful efforts of an experienced copyist and expert proof reader having access to and comparing in every possible case the copies with the originals. This initial Diary of Washington opens with his sixteenth year, and plainly shows the energy and the maturity of his judgment, and his capability to discharge even then important trusts with efficiency.
Forthcoming volumes will give, in chronological order, his co-operation in the march of events on this continent, and his life and opinions as seen through the writings he left. This volume must be viewed as the work of a youth, making a few, brief and hurried memoranda while in the depths of the forest and intended for no eye but his own. The time is not far distant when an edition of Washington's more important papers will be called for in facsimile by some one of the photogravure processes now available for such purposes, because of the unquestionable fidelity to the original it secures and which is approximately arrived at in this publication.
This is the first systematic attempt to produce the writings of Washington with literal exactness as to abbreviations, the use of capitals, punctuation, spelling, etc. It is possible that the plan pursued may[7] not, at first, meet with an unqualified commendation from the public. But if the editor does not much mistake the desire of students, the admirers of Washington and the demand of historians, this method, if faithfully executed, must produce the preferred edition of his writings.
A few miscellaneous pieces in Washington's youthful handwriting are preserved in this Journal, and are here printed with the same effort for literal accuracy which has been bestowed upon the Journal itself, and upon his field notes of land surveys.

INTRODUCTION.

This journal of George Washington, now for the first time printed entire and with literal exactness, was begun, as shown by the date in the opening lines, when he was but one month over sixteen years of age. It is his own daily record of observations during his first remunerated employment. His proficiency as a surveyor, and his fortitude in encountering the hardships of the forest in this expedition were, considering his age, truly remarkable. With him the beginning determined the end. Biographers have made us acquainted with the character of his worthy parents, and with the sturdy stock from which they were descended. It does seem as though Providence called our Washington into being, and educated him in the western world just at the time when a great leader was wanted to direct a revolution, and to found on this continent a new and a free, English-speaking nation. Every factor, whether of lineage or culture, in the admirably balanced character of Washington, as well as every aspiration of his heart, from his cradle to his grave, is of high interest to the world. Although deprived of a father's care at the age of[10] eleven years, he was, however, especially blessed in having such a mother as the noble Mary Washington, who conscientiously discharged her sacred duty as his guardian, counselor and friend. Hence filial reverence grew with his growth and strengthened with his maturing years into fixed principles, making him throughout all his eventful life loyal to every virtue and heroic in every trust.
When George Washington set out on the enterprise herein narrated, he was just out of school, where he had received the best education the neighborhood could supply, supplemented with good private instruction. We may well believe that his mother and his brothers then supposed that George had attained an age and proficiency when he should either go to college to acquire a higher education, or embark speedily in some respectable calling; and we may further conclude that this precocious youth was eager to take part in the affairs of life, and deferentially announced his preference for the latter course. Possibly he was influenced in this selection by his great admiration for his half-brother, Major Lawrence Washington, who was actively and prosperously engaged in various business enterprises, who made much of George, and had him visit Mount Vernon whenever it was practicable.
George Washington's aptitude for mathematics early attracted the attention of his teachers, and his beautifully kept copy-books, which are still preserved, attest his unusual ability in mathematical demonstra[11]tion and diagrams. Mr. Williams, the principal of the Academy in Westmoreland county, Va., where young Washington was, to give a practical value to this mathematical talent, had added surveying and navigation to his other studies; and these were soon mastered by this bright pupil. Land surveying was then a profitable and genteel pursuit in the colonies, and it comported well with Washington's tastes and inclinations. While visiting his brother at Mount Vernon, he had repeatedly amused himself and entertained guests of the house by surveying, in their presence, the garden, or a field, and rapidly drawing plats of them as an exercise. A few maps of such early surveys have been preserved. One of them, of Lawrence Washington's turnip field, bearing date 27 Feb., 1747-8, is reproduced in fac-simile in this publication. The others are without date, but are of about the same period; although one, namely that of "Hell Hole," a part of the Mount Vernon estate, and frequently mentioned in Washington's later diaries, may have been an earlier production. A fac-simile of it may also be found in this work.
Washington's efficiency and enthusiasm as a surveyor were observed and admired not only by his friend and companion, George William Fairfax, but also by the Hon. Wm. Fairfax and by Lord Fairfax, who were constantly employing surveyors to lay off lands for sale in the latter's large domain known as "The Northern Neck" of Virginia. During the early spring of 1748 the demands for surveys were[12] more than usually pressing by actual settlers in the Shenandoah valley. Lord Fairfax engaged the youth, George Washington, to proceed with George William Fairfax, his agent, as recorded in this journal, to execute certain commissions and meet a pressing demand. His surveys and reports gave entire satisfaction and led to his steady employment by his titled patron, principally as a director of his lordship's land office and of the surveys, preparatory to sale. Washington filled this position for about three years, when he was called upon to accompany his brother Lawrence, who, from failing health, was constrained, in the fall of 1751, to visit the West Indies in the hope of finding relief.
The journal kept by George Washington during his visit to Barbadoes in company with his brother, will be given in a separate work soon to be issued in its chronological order by the editor. The journal here presented to the public is, in the main, confined to Washington's daily entries, memoranda and field notes of surveys of land situated between the Blue Ridge and the Alleghany mountains.
Unfortunately the records of his surveys are not consecutive, and it is quite evident that they represent but a part, and probably but a small part, of the land surveyed by Washington for Lord Fairfax and others. The notes of surveys here published are all that can be found or that are now known to exist. It is to be hoped, however, that if other books of his field notes of surveys have escaped destruction, they may yet be[13] discovered. This hope is encouraged from the fact that the laws of the colony required surveyors, upon retiring from their official stations as county surveyors, to deposit their field books of notes of surveys with the records of the county. How far this law was complied with, the editor is unable to say. It is a mistake, however, to infer that Washington was constantly employed in actually running lines and taking field notes. He was largely charged with the supervision of Lord Fairfax's land office, and the records thereto belonging, and was his principal adviser in his land surveys, directing the men employed in the field work.
This journal, with its memoranda and surveys, makes a valuable addition to our knowledge of the life and employments of Washington in his youth. Here are also preserved the names of nearly three hundred of the early settlers and first land owners in the great valley of Virginia, for whom Washington made surveys, or who assisted him in this business.
It was a cherished hope of the editor that he might be able to give, in notes, brief sketches of the pioneers in the valley here named, through the assistance of their descendants, who, in many instances, reside upon lands surveyed by Washington for their ancestors. In this, however, he has been disappointed.
The journal, memoranda and surveys found in these books have all been copied with literal exactness and are here printed just as they were recorded by the hand of their author. This literalness is ad[14]hered to in the interest of truth and for the benefit of earnest students of history unable to consult personally the originals. Washington requires no apology for any apparent want of style or other marks of hasty composition in this journal. It was written in the nature of a memorandum intended for himself alone. His thoughts, even in these youthful productions, flow easily and in an orderly and consecutive manner. His sentences are never involved or obscure, and his observations are always apt and instructive; and, although a youth in years when this journal was written, he was dealing ably with important interests, and deporting himself in a manly manner, and associating on terms of intimacy with the foremost men of the day. He seems to have had no idle boy life, but was a man with manly instincts and ambitions from his youth. Time and accidents are slowly, but effectually, destroying the precious original manuscripts, so that a literal and authentic copy is a great desideratum. No liberty whatever is taken by the editor with the text as recorded by Washington. The notes which are added, it is hoped, may prove of interest.

JOURNAL.

A Journal of my Journey over the Mountains began Fryday the 11th of March 1747-8.[1]
Fryday March 11th 1747-8. Began my Journey[2] in Company with George Fairfax, Esqr.;[3] we travell'd this day 40 Miles to Mr George Neavels[4] in Prince William County.[5]
[1] Double dating of the year, as is done here, was an old custom observed between January 1st and the 25th of March. For all other portions of the year a single date was used. Although January 1st had been generally accepted as the beginning of the historical year in Christian countries, yet March 25th was held by some as the beginning of the civil or legal year. The Gregorian chronology or new style had not, at the time this journal was written, been adopted by England, and, indeed, was not until September 2nd, 1752.
[2] The party on this expedition set out from "Belvoir," the home and plantation of the Hon. William Fairfax, described by General Washington as "within full view of Mount Vernon, separated by water only, is one of the most beautiful seats on the river." (Letter to John Sinclair, 11 December, 1796.) It was founded by William Fairfax, cousin and agent to Lord Thomas Fairfax, and was his residence until his death in 1757. The estate then passed to his eldest son, George William Fairfax, also one of Lord Fairfax's agents, and was his residence until July, 1773, when, accompanied by his wife, he went to England to attend to some property he had inherited there. Washington, his friend and neighbor, consented to act as his agent during his absence, which, at the time, neither anticipated would be of long continuance.
[16]
"Law's delay" and business interests making it important for Mr. Fairfax to remain in England, he directed Washington to dispose of his stock, farm fixtures and household effects at public sale. After due advertisement, this was done August 15, 1774. A second sale at "Belvoir" took place December 5, 1774.
The following bill of household effects bought at this first sale at Belvoir by George Washington has been preserved among his private papers and was in the possession of one of his inheritors, Lawrence Washington, in January 1891. The bill in the auctioneer's handwriting was folded and endorsed in Washington's known hand:—"Articles bought by Go Washington at Colo Fairfax's Sale 15 August 1774."

The following admirable description of the estate is taken from an advertisement in the Pennsylvania Gazette of Philadelphia, October 19, 1774:
"To be rented from year to year, or for a term of years,—Belvoir, the beautiful seat of the Honorable Geo. W. Fairfax, Esq., upon the Potomac river, in Fairfax county, about 14 miles below Alexandria.
"The mansion is of brick, two stories high, with four convenient rooms, and a large passage on the lower floor; five rooms and a large passage on the second; servants' hall and cellar below; convenient to it are offices, stables and coach-house; adjacent is a large and well furnished garden stored with a great variety of fruits, all in good order.
"Appertaining to the tract on which these houses stand and which contains near 2,000 acres (surrounded in a manner by navigable water), are several valuable fisheries and a good deal of clear land in different parts which may be let all together or separately as shall be found most convenient.
[18]
"The terms may be known of Colonel Washington who lives near the premises, or of me in Berkeley county.
"Francis Willis, Junior."
The estate was leased to the Rev. Andrew Morton for a term of seven years. Unfortunately the mansion was destroyed by fire only a few years later. The owner's long absence, and the fact that there was no house to invite a careful tenant, together with the excitement and derangement of business incident to the war for independence, caused the estate rapidly to depreciate in value. Early in 1775 Washington relinquished the agency of George W. Fairfax's business in America, as his time was fully taken up in directing the momentous affairs of the Revolution.
[3] George William Fairfax, eldest son of the Hon. William Fairfax, of "Belvoir," Va., was born in Nassau, New Providence, West Indies, in 1724. His father having been appointed to the custom house in Salem, Massachusetts, he was taken to that town and resided there until 1734, about which time his father accepted the agency of Lord Fairfax's lands in Virginia, and removed to that province. For a time he resided in Westmoreland county, Va., but after a couple of years he settled upon and developed the "Belvoir" estate on the Potomac river. George William Fairfax was educated in England, and coming to his majority settled at "Belvoir," and married Sarah, daughter of Col. Wilson Cary, of Hampton, Va., who some writers, on rather apocryphal testimony, endeavor to show was an object of Washington's ardent devotion when a mere youth. The same compliment has also been claimed for her sister Mary, who married Edward Ambler, and for other belles of that period in Virginia, as well as in some of the other colonies. George W. Fairfax, after his marriage, resided part of the time at "Belvoir," and part at "Greenway Court," as agent of Lord Fairfax, in the vicinity of which he owned and cultivated lands. On his father's death in 1757 he inherited "Belvoir," where he continued to reside until the summer of 1773, when, accompanied by his wife, he went to England to look after some property he had inherited there. The proprietors of "Belvoir" and "Mount Vernon" and their families were always on the most friendly terms, as the letters extant of each attest, and Washington's diaries fully confirm. Mr. Fairfax[19] favored the early protests by the colonies and petitions to the king in the interests of the colonies, but opposed measures looking to forcible resistance. Washington consented to act as his agent while he was absent, presuming his stay in England would be of short duration. But a complication of matters detained him abroad so that he instructed his agent to sell off his stock at "Belvoir" and lease the property. A sale was accordingly held on the estate in August, 1774, which continued two days. A second and further sale was held in December the same year. The property was leased in 1774 for seven years, but shortly after this the mansion house was burned down and never rebuilt. During the Revolutionary war some of Mr. Fairfax's property in Fairfax county was escheated to the state. His loss of income from America led him to limit his expense, he therefore removed from Yorkshire to Bath and lived in a modest way, dividing generously, from his limited means, with the American prisoners of war held in England. He had no children. A friendly correspondence was kept up between him and Washington to the close of his life. He was urged to return to America, but his mansion at "Belvoir" having been destroyed by fire he kept putting it off and never returned. He left "Belvoir" and some other landed property to Ferdinand, son of his half-brother, Rev. Bryan Fairfax, and died at Bath in England, April 3, 1787, and was buried in Wirthlington church. His will appointed George Washington as one of his executors. His wife survived him until 1812. Her remains were placed by the side of her husband's.
[4] George Neville, Esq., was among the earliest planters to settle in the western part of Prince William county, Va. As early as, or before 1730, he selected a large body of desirable land lying on the main road by way of Ashby's Gap from Fredericksburg to Winchester. Here his residence was beautifully situated on high, healthy and productive land near the head springs of Bull Run, a tributary of the Occoquan river, and 34 miles from Fredericksburg, the head of tide water on the Rappahannock river. Squire Neville, the proprietor of this fine estate, as he was usually called, was a man of steady and industrious habits, possessed a fine constitution, gentle in his manners, and cultured in his tastes, enterprising and thrifty, with a genius for overcoming such difficulties as always beset[20] the path of the pioneer in a new country. As the lands to the west of him, and particularly those in the Shenandoah valley beyond the Blue Ridge, began to attract settlers the travel on the road past his house became considerable, and as a matter of accommodation to the public he opened an ordinary and kept a store for general merchandizing. Neville's Ordinary was a land mark, and is to be found on Fry and Jefferson's Map of Virginia, as well as on Governor Pownall's and other early maps of Virginia. In 1750 Washington surveyed for Mr. Neville 400 acres of land. By marriage George Neville was related to the Fairfax family of Virginia. His wife, Ann Burroughs, was a cousin to Lord Thomas Fairfax of "Greenway Court," the proprietor of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Squire Neville and his wife were blessed with a numerous family of healthy sons and daughters, who inherited the sturdy virtues of their parents, and who founded families for themselves, and whose descendants are to be found throughout the southern and western states. Joseph Neville, son of George, was a prosperous planter in the western part of Prince William county, Va., in 1760. (See Washington's Diary.) He served as a colonel in the Revolution, was one of the commissioners for running the boundary line between Pennsylvania and Virginia, and was a member of Congress 1793-5; died in Hardy county, Va., 1819. John Neville, another son, was colonel of the 4th Virginia regiment in the Revolution, and brigadier-general in the Pennsylvania militia at the close of the war. He was born in Virginia 26 July, 1731. From his youth he had a fondness for military affairs and served in the Braddock expedition, and also in the Dunmore Indian war. He and his brothers were early and life-long friends of General Washington, the acquaintance beginning when they were youths. At an early date John Neville took up considerable tracts of land in Frederick and Augusta counties, Va. He resided for some years in the Shenandoah valley, being at one time sheriff of Frederick county. He also acquired large tracts of land on Chartier's creek in Pennsylvania, and had built himself a house preparatory to taking up his residence there, when the Revolutionary war began, in which he took an active and honorable part. This event postponed, for some years, his removal with his family to Pennsylvania. On the 24th August, 1754, he was united in marriage to Winifred Oldham, by whom he had two[21] children, a son and a daughter, Presley and Amelia. Presley Neville married Nancy, daughter of General Daniel Morgan, and they became the progenitors of the large and influential family of Nevilles of Pittsburg, Pa. Colonel Presley Neville, as he was called, served in the Revolution for three years on the staff of General Lafayette. Amelia Neville married Major Isaac Craig of the Revolution, and they became the founders of the well known and esteemed family of Craigs of Pittsburg.—Eagle's Pennsylvania Genealogies.
[5] Prince William county, Va., formed in 1730 from Stafford and King George counties, embraced territory extending from the Potomac river on the east to the summit of the Blue Ridge on the west; it was divided from Loudoun county by the Occoquan and Bull Run streams. Prior to 1822 the county seat was at Dumfries, but at that date it was removed to Brentville.
Saturday March 12th this Morning Mr James Genn ye surveyor[6] came to us, we travel'd over ye Blue Ridge[7] to Capt Ashbys[8] on Shannondoah River,[9] Nothing remarkable happen'd.
[6] James Genn, a licensed surveyor in Virginia, much employed by Lord Fairfax, and frequently mentioned by Washington, and whose name often appears signed to surveys in which the latter was engaged, as the surveyor or director, is doubtless the person to whom reference is here made.
[7] Blue Ridge—the most easterly of the mountain ranges of the United States. The name properly restricted however, applies especially to that portion of the Appalachian range south of the Potomac river. In some parts of Pennsylvania it is known as Kittatinny and at some places in Maryland as South Mountain. It attains its greatest altitude in Virginia at the Peaks of Otter, which are about 4,000 feet above sea level.
[8] Capt. Ashby resided on the Shenandoah river above Burwell's island and the great bend of that stream, at which place he maintained a ferry and kept a house of entertainment. It was on the natural line by which travel came from the tide-water region of Virginia, through a gap in the Blue Ridge and across the Shenandoah valley to the country beyond. Being a[22] man of great courage and usefulness, he was deservedly popular among the early settlers, and his name was given not only to his ordinary but also to the gap and to the ferry. There was, too, a Fort Ashby on Patterson creek, near the town of Frankfort. There are numerous families bearing the name of Ashby throughout the southern and western states, who are probably descendants of this famous pioneer. General Turner W. Ashby, an officer of distinction in the Confederate army, is presumably of this family. The name still attaches to the gap in the mountains, but it has been superseded at the old ferry.
[9] Shenandoah river—this is the largest tributary of the Potomac. The name is of Indian origin, and in the aboriginal language is said to signify "the daughter of the stars." Kercheval, in his History of the Valley of Virginia, says the name was first written Gerando, then Sherandoch, and now we have Shenandoah. The river has its head in Augusta county near the divide where the head-waters of the James river take their rise. The Shenandoah flows for about 170 miles through a broad valley over a limestone bed between the North mountain on the one side and the Blue Ridge on the other, to the Potomac river at Harper's Ferry. This valley was the theater of many important military operations during the late war. The name of Sherando is perpetuated in the name of a post-office in Augusta county on the head-waters of the Shenandoah.

[10] Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord and Baron of Cameron, born in England in 1691, died at his residence "Greenway Court," Frederick county, Virginia, on the 12th of December, 1781. His remains were interred within the Episcopal church of Winchester, Va. His residence and other improvements were familiarly called "Quarters" and "Hunting Lodge," chiefly because he had in contemplation the erection of a commodious mansion. Lord Fairfax was the son of Thomas, 5th Lord Fairfax[23] and his wife Catherine, daughter of Lord Culpeper, once governor of Virginia. He was educated at Oxford and afterward held a commission in the British army. He was a fine scholar, and is said to have been a contributor to The Spectator. He succeeded to his father's title and to his mother's extensive landed estate known as the "Northern Neck of Virginia," lying between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers and estimated at 5,700,000 acres. For some years after coming into possession of this property it was left in the hands of agents. He finally employed his cousin, the Hon. William Fairfax, son of Henry and Anne (Harrison) Fairfax, as his agent in the management of his lands. About 1739 Lord Fairfax first visited his estate in America. For a year he devoted himself to becoming thoroughly acquainted with his possessions and then returned to England. Four years later, in 1745, he returned to this country and for a time made his home at "Belvoir," the seat of his relative and agent.
A branch office for the sale of lands in the valley of Virginia, had been opened in Frederick county in 1742. The main office and records, however, were not removed from "Belvoir" until 1761.
Lord Fairfax built for himself a stone lodge with quarters for his servants, reserving around it a manor of 10,000 acres which he called "Greenway Court." The lodge was about twelve miles south-east of Winchester, at which place he purposed to build a castle, but this was never erected. His lodge was, however, sufficiently spacious for him to live in comfortably, and exercise a generous hospitality. He possessed a good library and was frequently visited by men of note whom he entertained in an elegant manner. He was fond of the chase and took an active interest in the management of his estate, as well as in the affairs of the colony, as his letters fully prove. He identified himself with the people as far as was practicable, and was deservedly popular. He served as lieutenant of Frederick county in the militia organizations; presided as one of the judges in the county courts at Winchester, and was an overseer of the public roads.
He met at "Belvoir," George Washington, when a youth, and, pleased with his energy and talents, employed him to survey lands beyond the Blue Ridge, which were to be sold. This was Washington's first remunerated employment. The[24] acquaintance thus begun, ripened into a friendship that was cherished by both through life.
Although a frank loyalist, his age and prudence in refraining from all participation in the Revolutionary struggle, protected him from being interfered with either by the government or by his neighbors. He died at the age of ninety-three, before peace was restored. His barony and its prerogatives, according to English law, descended, in the absence of a son, to his eldest brother, Robert, who thus became 7th Lord Fairfax. The latter died in Leeds Castle, England, 1791, without a son. The baronial title then fell to the Rev. Bryan Fairfax, of "Towlston Hall," Fairfax county, Va., who died 7 August, 1802. The great landed estates with their entails were, however, in effect confiscated by the success of the Revolution. The Legislature of Virginia in 1785 passed an act in relation to the "Northern Neck" to the following effect. "And be it further enacted, that the land holders within the said district of the Northern Neck shall be for ever hereafter exhonorated and discharged from composition and quit rents, any laws, customs or usage, to the contrary notwithstanding." Revised Code of the Laws of Virginia, vol. 1, p. 351, 2, 3. "Greenway Court" was devised by his lordship to his nephew, Rev. Denny Martin, residing in England, on condition of his obtaining the consent of Parliament to change his name to Fairfax. This was done, and he was afterward known as "Denny, Lord Fairfax." Like his uncle, he left no children and therefore bequeathed the estate to two maiden sisters in England. The legatees of the Fairfax estate sold their interest to Chief Justice John Marshall, Raleigh Colston, Esq. and General Henry Lee. They divided it up and sold it out in small farms, and quieted the titles. It is believed that no part of this vast body of Fairfax land is now held by any member of the family.—Sparks, Drake and others.
Monday 14th We sent our Baggage to Capt Hites[11] (near Frederick Town)[12] went ourselves down ye River about 16 Miles to Capt Isaac Penningtons (the Land exceeding Rich &amp; Fertile all ye way produces abundance of Grain Hemp Tobacco &amp;ca) in order[25] to Lay of some Lands on Cates Marsh &amp; Long Marsh.[13]

A Plan of a piece of Meadow called Hell Hole Situate on the River Potowmack near Little Hunting Creek
[11] Capt. Joist Hite came to Virginia from Pennsylvania in 1732 with his family, settled on the Opequon creek about five miles south of the town of Winchester. The year before he had bought from John and Isaac Van Meter a warrant for nearly 40,000 acres of land in the Shenandoah valley which they had obtained from Governor Gooch of Virginia in 1730. Capt. Hite brought with him from Pennsylvania sixteen families, all of whom settled in the same vicinity on fine arable ground. They were all judges of good lands and devoted to agriculture. The descendants of Hite are quite numerous throughout the southern and south-western states, and many farms in the valley are still held under titles derived from him. Kercheval says, Joist Hite built a stone house on the Opequon shortly after his coming to the valley. It is still standing and has a very ancient appearance though there are no discoverable marks to fix the date. On the wall plate of a frame barn, however, built by Hite, the figures "1747" are plainly marked and can still be read.
[12] "Frederick Town," properly Winchester, is the capital of Frederick county, Va. The latter was formed out of Orange county by Act of Assembly of Virginia in 1738, at the same time that Augusta county was formed. The choice of this site for the capital of the county was determined by the simple fact that a few hardy, adventurous Indian traders, as early as 1732 or even before that date, had built themselves cabins at this point known as the "Big Shawane Springs." These settlers gradually attracted others until a village was developed. This spring or one near it, an example of the great springs which are to be found in most limestone regions, furnishes the town of Winchester, to the present time, with an abundant supply of pure potable water. The site of the town was, all things considered, well chosen, in a fertile region and on the line of travel, whether across the valley to the Alleghany mountains and the waters of the Ohio river beyond, or along the great valley of the Shenandoah. James Wood was the projector of the town of Winchester, which was incorporated in 1752 by the Assembly of Virginia. However, twenty-six lots had been laid out[26] and sold by James Wood prior to this. Lord Fairfax shortly after this date made an addition to the town, and donated the ground for an Episcopal church. Frederick county early took measures to give protection to its settlers by building forts, making roads and establishing ferries. Its productive soil at the same time bountifully rewarded the husbandman for his labor. As the Frederick county courts were held at Winchester, the people adopted the southern habit of calling the place where the courts met by the name of the county, thus it was frequently spoken of as Frederick Town and is so designated in several of the early maps. Fort Loudoun was erected here by direction of the Assembly of Virginia in 1756, under the immediate supervision of Major Washington.
[13] Cate's marsh and Long marsh—these are names of small streams which flow from the foot hill of North mountain to the Shenandoah river and have along their course considerable meadow or marshy land. Long marsh is of sufficient importance to be named upon the maps of Virginia.
Tuesday 15th We set out early with Intent to Run round ye sd Land but being taken in a Rain &amp; it Increasing very fast obliged us to return, it clearing about one oClock &amp; our time being too Precious to Loose we a second time ventured out &amp; Worked hard till Night &amp; then return'd to Penningtons we got our Suppers &amp; was Lighted into a Room &amp; I not being so good a Woodsman as ye rest of my Company striped myself very orderly &amp; went in to ye Bed as they called it when to my Surprize I found it to be nothing but a Little Straw—Matted together without Sheets or any thing else but only one thread Bear blanket with double its Weight of Vermin such as Lice Fleas &amp;c[14] I was glad to get up (as soon as y [27]Light was carried from us) I put on my Cloths &amp; Lays as my Companions.

[14] For comments on fleas and other vermin see note 4. Washington's "Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour," p. 14, Washington's association with frontiersmen in their primitive cabins, which the position of a surveyor in the then almost unbroken forest necessitated, was to him a new and peculiar experience. His observations and reflections of the first few days are recorded with a naivete which is truly charming.

[15] This probably has reference to some pernicious weeds unfavorable to tillage and injurious to grazing animals, as St. John's wort. Farmers believe that this, and certain other noxious weeds which occasionally invade pasture fields, cause sore mouths and legs in horses and horned cattle and affect the milk of cows grazing where it grows.
Wednesday 16th We set out early &amp; finish'd about one oClock &amp; then Travell'd up to Frederick Town where our Baggage came to us we cleaned ourselves (to get Rid of y. Game[16] we had catched y. Night before) &amp; took a Review of y. Town &amp; thence return'd to our Lodgings where we had a good Dinner prepar'd for us Wine &amp; Rum Punch[17] in Plenty &amp; a good Feather Bed[18] with clean Sheets which was a very agreeable regale.
[16] This facetious term "game," referring to his misfortune the first night he lodged in the valley, has a touch of humor in it; and while it is true that Washington was not given to punning or indulging in witticisms, he was not deficient in imagination or unappreciative of the exercise of this talent on suitable occasions by others. He knew that good humor minimized most of the petty annoyances of life.
[17] The office and art of the surveyor were held in high esteem by the early settlers. It is, therefore, not surprising that the people for whom surveys were executed, made special efforts to give the surveying parties good dinners, even going so far as to[29] set before them "wine and rum punch." I may add here that there is neither tradition nor record that Washington was ever known to have been indiscreet from youth to age in the use of wine or strong drinks.
[18] Feather beds, a great luxury in former times, have nearly gone out of use among well-to-do people. By the wealthy, as well as by the laborers, they were once a greatly prized comfort and often devised by will as valuable inheritances. Hair, cotton and spring mattresses have displaced them from popular favor, but "clean sheets" belong to the category of comforts in even early times and must be a delight and joy forever.

[19] Cohongoruton—the Indian name by which the Potomac river was known to the Six Nations and other tribes of Indians. From its head-waters, to Point Lookout in the Chesapeake bay, this stream is the dividing line between Maryland and Virginia.
[20] The "Warm Springs," now known as "Bath" or "Berkeley Springs," were already famed, as Washington notes, in[30] 1747. They were deservedly popular for many years, but their remoteness and the difficulty of access to them, with the competition of other resorts more easily reached, prevented their receiving the attention which the value of their waters merited. A settlement sprang up about the springs at an early date, which finally became a prosperous village under the name of Bath, and was made the county seat when, in 1820, the county of Morgan was formed. Washington bought lots here, built a cottage and stables, and passed summers here with his family. His half-brother, Lawrence, spent nearly a year at the springs for the benefit of his health before going to England and later to Barbadoes. The property-right in the springs is in the state of Virginia, and is held for the benefit of the public.
Sonday 20th finding y. River not much abated we in y. Evening Swam our horses over &amp; carried them to Charles Polks in Maryland for Pasturage till y. next Morning.
Monday 21st We went over in a Canoe &amp; Travell'd up Maryland side all y. Day in a Continued Rain to Collo Cresaps[21] right against y. Mouth of y. South Branch[22] about 40 Miles from Polks I believe y. worst Road that ever was trod by Man or Beast.
[21] Cresap, Col. Thomas, the founder of the family in America, was born in Skipton, Yorkshire, England, and at the age of about fifteen came to America. Some five years later he resided at Havre-de-Grace, Md., where he married a Miss Johnson. Removing thence to Wright's Ferry, opposite the town of Columbia, where he obtained a Maryland title to a 500 acre tract of land called "Peach Bottom," and built himself a small stone house. The land, however, was on disputed territory, and claimants under the laws of Pennsylvania finally dispossessed him. His next move was to a locality in what is now Washington county, Md., where he located and settled upon a[31] tract of 1,400 acres on the Antietam creek, called "Long Meadows," and began trading with the Indians. After collecting a large lot of furs and skins he shipped them to England but was financially ruined through the capture of the vessel by the French. Unable to repay money he had borrowed from Mr. Dulany, of Maryland, he gave up to him his land, and moved farther west, built a cabin a few miles above the junction of the north and south branches of the Potomac, on the Maryland side, at a place which became known as "Old Town," but which he called Skipton, the name of his Yorkshire birthplace. This frontier spot became his permanent residence, where he eventually owned a large body of land on both sides of the Potomac. From his familiarity with the Indians and their habits and character, he was enabled to carry on with great advantage his trade with them and in time became the most important frontiersman of his day in Maryland. He took part with the Washingtons, Lee, Mason and others in the formation and early operations of "The Ohio Company," and in all matters of dealing with the Indians and prospecting for wild lands was the Company's chief dependence. With the aid of Namacolin, a noted Indian hunter, he laid out the first road over the Alleghany mountains to the head-waters of the Ohio. Gen. Braddock's expedition, and later the National road, followed nearly the same route. The attention attracted to the Ohio region through this Company's explorations, made it increasingly important to both England and France to possess and control the lands beyond the Ohio. This vigilance precipitated the war that drove out the French and secured to England and America the vast dominion known as the Northwest.
Col. Cresap's literary acquirements were small, but he had a vigorous mind, strong common sense, and was not deficient in practical self-education. He was one of the surveyors of Prince George's county which, at that period, embraced all the western part of Maryland. January 1, 1745, he surveyed for Gov. Thomas Bladen "Walnut Bottom" just below the mouth of Wills creek. He frequently represented his county in the Legislature and being noted for his clear understanding, sound judgment, firmness and courage, was esteemed one of the best legislators his county ever had. He was of medium stature, firmly set, of sound constitution, and lived to the uncommon[32] age of 105 or 106. He was twice married, the second time at the age of 80; by his first wife he had five children; three sons, Daniel, Thomas and Michael, and two daughters, Sarah and Elizabeth. Captain Michael Cresap was the person upon whom Thomas Jefferson fixed the stigma of the murder of the relatives of Logan. Jefferson having transmitted the pathetic speech of the Indian chief to the Abbe Raynal as an evidence of the original power of oratory of the aboriginal American, it is claimed more in a spirit of literary conceit than of conviction; however he failed during his life to correct the injustice done Cresap, although he was repeatedly furnished with the evidence exculpating Cresap and fixing the barbarous act on one Great-house. At his home, Col. Cresap dispensed, for his time and means, a generous hospitality to all callers, in a region where, as yet, no public houses were to be found. He kept a big kettle ready suspended to place a fire under, near a spring for the use of the Indians who often passed his place, and for this reason they designated him the "Big Spoon." Lord Baltimore employed him to run a survey of the western line of Maryland, and to ascertain which of the two branches of the Potomac was the largest. His autograph map of this survey is still preserved in the archives of the state of Maryland.
[22] The South Branch of the Potomac, of which the Indian name was Wappotomaka, rises in Pendleton county, West Virginia, among the spurs of the Alleghany and North mountains, and meets the North Branch about 20 miles below Cumberland, Md. The latter branch has been accepted as the dividing line between Maryland and Virginia, although now known to be neither as long nor as large as the South Branch. A line drawn due north from the extreme head-waters of the South Branch would run ten miles to the west of a parallel line from the head springs of the North Branch, thus proving the loss by Maryland of this strip of territory, as well as the region between the two branches, had the South Branch been taken instead of the North Branch as the main river referred to in the Royal Charter, and made the line separating the contiguous colonies. The valley through which the South Branch flows is broad and its lands very fertile, causing them to be much sought after for farms by the hardy pioneers in the early days before the Revolution. It was then familiarly known as the "upper tract" of Virginia.

Tuesday 22d Continued Rain and y. Freshes kept us at Cresaps.
Wednesday 23d Rain'd till about two oClock &amp; Clear'd when we were agreeably surpris'd at y. sight of thirty odd Indians coming from War with only one Scalp[23] We had some Liquor with us of which we gave them Part it elevating there Spirits put them in y.

[23] Scalp—a term applied to the tissues covering the human head, and embracing all the hairy integuments and flattened muscles from the back of the skull to the brow above the eyes. Taking the scalp of an enemy, living or dead, has been held from remote times as a special sign of victory and token of triumph. The North American Indians, particularly during the early colonial wars, took the scalps of their enemies, preserving and exhibiting them with savage pride and occasionally wearing them as decorations and trophies. The assembly of Virginia, in 1755, established a reward of £10 for every scalp[34] of a male Indian above the age of twelve (Hening's Statutes, vol. VI, p. 551). In 1757 this sum was raised to £15, and £30 more for every scalp taken within the next two years (Hening, VII, p. 122). Maryland and Pennsylvania also offered rewards for Indian scalps.
[24] The war dance of the Indians probably had a significance to their minds not understood by civilized man, and was not to them the meaningless custom it seems to us. It has frequently been described and painted by eye-witnesses. In 1857 Virtue, Emmins &amp; Co. copyrighted a very effective engraving of a war dance in the forest, arranged from Washington's description of it in this journal.
Fryday 25th 1748 Nothing Remarkable on thursday but only being with y. Indians all day so shall slip it this day left Cresaps &amp; went up to y. mouth of Patersons Creek[25] &amp; there swam our Horses over got over ourselves in a Canoe &amp; traveld up y. following Part of y. Day to Abram Johnstones 15 Miles from ye Mouth where we camped.
[25] Paterson Creek rises in Hampshire county, West Virginia, and empties into the Potomac about twelve miles below Cumberland, Md. On the old maps of Evans, Hutchins and Lewis, the name is given as Pattison. There are large tracts of good, arable land along the valley and bottoms adjacent to this stream. They began to attract settlements a little before the time Fort Cumberland was built. Fort Ashby was also erected to protect settlers along this stream.
Saterday 26 Travelld up ye Creek to Solomon Hedges Esqr one of his Majestys Justices of ye Peace for ye County of Frederick where we camped when we came to Supper there was neither a Cloth upon ye Table nor a Knife to eat with but as good luck would have it we had Knives of own.[26]
[26] Knife and fork at table.—Polished nations have usages[35] which, at first view, appear natural or common to all mankind. This, however, is not the fact. That there was a period in the history of our race when the knife and fork were unknown to the furnishings of the table, cannot well be doubted; and there was even a time when the table itself was not deemed an essential. At the present day the idea of eating a meal at table without the accompaniment of a knife and fork would excite disgust; their absence, however, in a remote Virginia mountain cabin in 1747-8 as here recorded, simply shows that they had not been provided nor deemed essential to the life of a hunter, not an ignorance of their use, as the two-pronged, iron, table fork was in common use at that period throughout the settlements in all the American colonies. It is nevertheless true that the knife and fork now deemed so necessary at table, are a much more modern convenience than is generally supposed. The king of Hungary, Coevinus, toward the close of the fifteenth century, as related by Galeotus Martius, ate his meat with his fingers as did all the guests at table. In Italy, the fork was, to a limited extent, in use at this time among the nobility. In France, at the end of the sixteenth century, forks were comparatively new at court. The use of the table fork is referred to in "Washington's Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour," and in Hawkins' Youths' Companion, the source of these rules printed about 1650. The knife is perhaps one of the most ancient of instruments, it was made of different metals and in a great variety of forms. The table knife was, however, contemporary with the fork. According to Chamberlin it was first made in England, in 1563. The use of the fork at table spread to Europe from Venice, in Italy. In 1608 it was brought to England by Thomas Coryate who, while traveling, observed its use in Italy and continued it himself on his return to England. (See his work entitled "Crudities.") It is rather disappointing that neither the Greeks nor Romans have even a name for the table fork. The flesh fork, called creagra, with a long handle, for cooks to take meat out of a boiling pot, was known and used by the Hebrews and the Greeks. But had the table fork been used by the latter or by the Romans, some specimens would have been found among those extensive ruins which have been so carefully explored by modern investigators. It is known that some articles have been found, the use of which conjecture assigns to the table,[36] but they are not forks and the surmise is not generally credited. The Chinese, who claim to have led the rest of the world in most of the economic inventions, seem to have overlooked the table fork and do not even now use it in cutting or conveying food to the mouth but employ in its stead the "chop sticks" which, it must be said in their praise, they use with skill and dexterity. It should be stated that large bronze forks were used by the Egyptians in presenting offerings to the gods. It is unpleasant to represent the tables of our ancestors of a few centuries back as without forks, yet this certainly was the fact. The silver table fork, which also had its evolution from two to four prongs, was first manufactured in 1662 by Heylin.
The small knife, formerly worn by gentlemen at their girdles, was used by them, not only as a weapon of defense, but also as an article of convenience in cutting their meat. However, the ancient custom of serving food at table was to have a servant cut meats and other food into small morsels before distributing it to guests. The wealthy employed a person whose special duty it was to carve the meats into proper and convenient pieces and his was the only knife in the dining hall. When the fork was first introduced into England, its employment was ridiculed as an effeminate practice, as may be seen in the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, and others where the persons using it are referred to as "your fork-carving-traveler."
Sunday 27th Travell'd over to y. South Branch attended with y. Esqr to Henry Vanmetriss[27] in order to go about Intended Work of Lots[28]
[27] Henry Van Metre or Meter.—There was a numerous family of the Van Meters in Virginia and they were among the earliest settlers in the valley of the Shenandoah, on the South Branch and along the upper Potomac. Kercheval, in his History of the Valley of Virginia, says this family came from New York and New Jersey. It is evident that they were people of energy and thrift, judges of good land. At a period antedating the settlements in the valley, it is stated by this historian that a John Van Meter, a sort of wandering Indian trader, of New York, accompanied the Delaware Indians in a war party against the Catawbas; but the Catawbas anticipating the attack,[37] surprised and defeated the Delawares in a battle fought near where the present court-house of Pendleton stands. John Van Meter escaped and returned to New York, but he was so impressed with the beauty and fertility of the lands on the South Branch bottom in Hardy county, that he advised his sons to secure lands and locate there. Of these sons, Isaac became a man of note and frequently represented Hardy county in the House of Delegates of Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia Convention of 1788 which ratified the Federal Constitution. In 1730, it is a matter of history that John and Isaac Van Metre, brothers, obtained from Gov. Gooch, of Virginia, a warrant for 40,000 acres of land to be located west of the mountains. This warrant, or a part of it, they sold to Joist Hite. A number of tracts on the original warrant were surveyed in the vicinity of Shepherdstown. The name of Van Meter is still frequently met with throughout West Virginia and has its monument in a stream forming the north-western boundary line of Jefferson county and emptying into the Potomac, and named on the maps of Virginia Van Meter's Marsh. A controversy as to the validity of the Van Metre patent was raised in 1738 by Lord Fairfax and taken into the courts for adjudication. Lord Fairfax contending that his grants covered the whole of the western end of the northern neck, while the holders claimed that the governor, under authority from the crown, had disposing power. This conflict as to title was a source of much litigation, and was not finally settled until after the Revolution, when all the parties to the original suits were dead.
[28] Lots.—This term, as used by surveyors, indicates portions, tracts, divisions and subdivisions of land. Each survey, lot or division when plotted is usually indicated by some name or device, as a number, a letter, or a symbol. So that each can then be described and referred to in a deed or an advertisement, and its location and boundaries be accurately and systematically defined and described in a book of land records.
Monday 28th: Travell'd up y Branch about 30 Miles to Mr James Rutlidges[29] Horse Jockey &amp; about 70 Miles from ye Mouth
[29] James Rutledge.—Kercheval, in his History of the Valley[38] of Virginia, says that prominent among the earliest settlers on the South Branch, before the arrival of the Van Meters, were the Howards, Coburns, Walkers and Rutledges.
Tuesday 29th This Morning went out &amp; Survey'd five Hundred Acres of Land &amp; went down to one Michael Stumps on ye So Fork of ye Branch on our way Shot two Wild Turkies[30]
[30] The wild turkey.—This is the largest and finest of our game birds and, although native to North America, it bears a foreign name from the following circumstances. Specimens of the living bird, as well as its eggs, were sent by the early Jesuit missionaries to the old world on Spanish and Portuguese ships, entering Europe through Portugal. It was as yet unnamed, and was at first referred to by writers of that period merely as the "Jesuit bird." As it became known, the demand for the stranger was supplied chiefly from Turkey where, for some reason, it thrived exceedingly well, and in time it came to be familiarly spoken of as "the turkey." Gradually becoming tame, and proving to be quite prolific, it was recognized as a great addition to the luxuries of the table. Speedily becoming a favorite in every country to which it was taken, the great forests and game preserves throughout Europe were gradually stocked with it and it was also raised as a domestic fowl. To-day the American turkey, derived as stated, is found wild in all the great forests of the old world, while the domesticated bird is abundantly raised everywhere in Europe for the markets. In ancient times, we are told, the choicest game fowls brought to a feast were pheasants and peacocks. Emigrants to America brought over with them the domesticated bird to its native land, but under a borrowed name. Washington, in his journal, April 7, 1748, records the fact that one of his men that day had killed a wild turkey weighing 20 pounds. The domesticated bird, when permitted to attain the age of two or three years, and being well fed during the winter months, often reaches the weight of 30 pounds or more. As marking in a degree the devastation of the late war and the enforced abandonment of plantations in the section of Virginia adjacent to the city of Washington, it is a fact worthy of record, that in[39] 1876 the newspapers chronicled the news that the thickets and pine forests which were grown up since the armies left were tenanted by wild deer and turkeys; foxes, etc. And to this day, December 25, 1890, wild turkeys are brought to the Washington market killed in Fairfax county, Va., within ten miles of Washington city.—Gentlemen's Magazine.

[31] Manor line.—In colonial times there were a number of manors, or great landed estates, granted under the then existing laws of England, to persons of note and quality in Virginia and in some of the other provinces. Holders of such estates enjoyed special rights and privileges. Manors were formerly called baronies and entitled the rightful possessor to lordships, and such lord or baron was empowered to hold domestic courts for redressing misdemeanors, nuisances and settling disputes among tenants. Among the manors of limited privileges in Virginia may be enumerated the "manor of Greenway Court," with a domain of 10,000 acres. The great "manor of Leeds," which has figured so extensively in the courts of Virginia, contained 150,000 acres within the counties of Culpeper, Fauquier and Frederick. The "South Branch manor," in Hardy county, embraced 55,000 acres; "Paterson Creek manor," in Hampshire county, 9,000 acres; and "Goony Run manor," adjoining that of Leeds and lying chiefly in Shenandoah county, 13,000[40] acres. "Beverley's manor," for the most part in Augusta county, consisted of 118,411 acres, and "Fairfax manor," in Hampshire, of 10,000 acres. There were still other manors in different parts of the state. In New York under the Dutch government the baron or proprietor of the manor lands was called the patroon.
[32] Clay lick.—Names of places or streams with the word lick either prefixed or affixed to them, such as "Salt lick," "Blue lick," "Grass lick," "Licking creek," etc., were usually given in consequence of the presence of some saline matter in the springs, streams or soil which attracted the wild animals and caused them to lick for the salt. Hunters in new settlements often built what they called blinds near these licks in which to conceal themselves, and waited there for the game to come, as they were pretty sure to do, almost daily, and at times in considerable numbers, when they could be readily killed.
Wednesday 30th This Morning began our Intended Business of Laying of Lots we began at ye Boundary Line of ye Northern 10 Miles above Stumps &amp; run of two Lots &amp; returnd to Stumps
The Courses &amp; Distances of ye Several Lots lay'd of on ye So Fork of Wappacomo[33] Began March 30th. 1748
[33] "Wappacomo," also spelled "Wappatomaka," was the Indian name for the South Branch of the Potomac. This stream courses through a fine valley from its head-springs in Pendleton county, and has many considerable branches rising among the spurs of the Alleghany mountains on the one side and the North or Cacapehon (Capon) mountain on the other, the latter separating it from the valley of Virginia on the east. The great or most noted fork of the South Branch is at Morefield in Hardy county. Washington surveyed much of the land in that section. The young farmers seeking good lands had come in taken up considerable tracts and built improvements before surveys were made or any effort to prove rights from either Lord Fairfax or the governor of Virginia.

[34] Vacant—this term, as used by surveyors, indicates that the tract of land so designated is neither claimed by an actual occupant or occupied by virtue of any official record. Many of the settlers on the lands of Lord Fairfax selected their farms and made improvements without any legal survey, warrant or title, other than a "tomahawk blaze" for a boundary mark, trusting that the actual owner of the land would recognize the improvement and occupant's claim and deal justly by them. These "tomahawk claims" were respected by the actual settlers, had a market value among land speculators and were admitted, to a certain extent, as evidence of rights in the courts.

[35] Dutch.—As early as 1730 there was a considerable settlement in the Shenandoah valley, of German immigrants and their descendants, who had first settled in Pennsylvania and then removed to, and taken up lands in, the valley of Virginia. They selected, chiefly, the good limestone lands with their centers of population near the head-waters of the Opequon creek, in Shenandoah, and the south-western part of Frederick county. They were all Protestants in religion. The town of Woodstock was originally and exclusively settled by Germans. The bill for its incorporation was reported to the House of Burgesses of Va., by Col. George Washington in 1761. For many years the German language was exclusively spoken in their settlement, and German customs and religious observances were retained[46] with tenacity, their remoteness and seclusion securing to them almost perfect freedom from innovations. The Revolution found them patriotic supporters of the colony as against the pretensions of Great Britain. It was in the town of Woodstock, Shenandoah county, that Maj.-Gen. John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, minister of the Lutheran church, dressed in his uniform and with his sword buckled on, preached a farewell sermon in 1776, to a sympathizing and patriotic congregation, and the next day marched as colonel at the head of his German regiment, known subsequently as the 8th Virginia, to join the Continental army. Such names of places as Strasburg, Hamburg, Mecklenburg, the latter now known as Shepherdstown, etc., perpetuate the fact that many of the earliest settlers in that section were German.—See Kercheval, p. 158.

[36] The Red Bud or Judas tree.—A common tree that grows wild in the United States. In botany it is known as the "Cercis Canadensis," and often grows to the height of 30 feet or more. It flowers in April, clothing its limbs in a reddish-purple bloom for a week or ten days before its leaves appear, and from this circumstance it is popularly called red bud.
[37] Blazed trees.—These are surveyors' marks made on trees to proclaim and identify certain routes or lines. The "blaze" is made by removing with an axe a strip of the outer bark of a tree or sapling, for about a foot in length and well into the inner bark. In the future growth of the tree a lighter color marks the cicatrix which rarely ever wholly disappears. Surveyors, to distinguish corner trees in a survey, not only blaze the sides of the tree in the direction their lines run but cut three small notches through the bark which will remain distinct during the life of the tree.
[38] Widow Wolf.—There was a Fort Wolf on Stony creek a few miles south-west of Woodstock, erected by the Germans at an early period in the settlement of the valley; there is also a marsh or creek named Wolf's marsh, which empties into the Shenandoah about twelve miles above Ashby's Ferry. Possibly these were so called from the name of this widow's husband.

[39] Old Fields and Wild Meadow.—There were many small, timberless tracts of land on the mountains and in the great valleys of Virginia and Pennsylvania, in regions which were generally, prior to the occupation and the clearing up of the country by the white man, densely covered with trees. Large tracts of such timberless land existed in the region now embraced within the counties of Berkeley, Jefferson and Frederick. Strange as it may appear some of this kind of land within the history of the settlement of the valley became covered with young forest timber. In some respects these openings resembled the treeless prairies of the west. No satisfactory explanation of this frequently observed condition has ever been given. Many of these meadows were the favorite pasturing grounds of the large game and were, therefore, of special interest to the hunter. Clearfield county, Pa., it is believed, got its name from the fact that there were within its territory extensive natural clear fields and meadows.
Fryday 8th we breakfasted at Casseys &amp; Rode down to Vanmetris's to get all our Company together which when we had accomplished we Rode down below ye Trough in order to Lay of Lots there we laid of one this day The Trough is couple of Ledges of Mountain Impassable running side &amp; side together for above 7 or 8 Miles &amp; ye River down between them you must Ride Round ye back of ye Mountain for to get below them we Camped this Night in ye Woods near a Wild Meadow where was a Large Stack of Hay after we had Pitched our Tent &amp; made a very[51] Large Fire we pull'd out our Knapsack in order to Recruit ourselves every was his own Cook our Spits was Forked Sticks our Plates was a Large Chip as for Dishes we had none

[40] From the expression, "set the surveyor to work," as well as the language used in the record on the 12th of March, that "Mr. James Genn the surveyor came to us and traveled over the Blue Ridge, etc.," with other expressions at a later date of similar import in the journal and in other documents, it is rendered almost certain that George Washington was, from the first, employed by Lord Fairfax, not as a surveyor, merely, but rather in the capacity of a skilled director of other surveyors, and as the confidential adviser in the division and sale of his lordship's lands.

[41] Williams' Gap, in the Blue Ridge, is on a line nearly due east from Winchester. It derived its name from a Mr. Williams, who kept a ferry over the Shenandoah river on one of the roads from Winchester into Loudoun and Fairfax counties. This name still attaches to the gap and appears on the early maps of Virginia. It is a notable fact that all or most of the important gaps through mountain passes in the United States were well worn buffalo paths and Indian trails when first visited by white men.
[42] Ashby's Bent is supposed to have reference to the great bend and extensive bottom lands of the Shenandoah, just above which was located Captain Ashby's ferry across that river. Washington uses this term in 1770 to describe a large tract of bottom land on the Ohio which he acquired.
[43] Fairfax county, in which Mount Vernon is located, was created out of Prince William county by the Assembly of Virginia in 1742.

[44] Major Lawrence Washington, proprietor of Mount Vernon, was the second child and oldest surviving son of Augustine and his first wife Jane (Butler) Washington, born at Pope's Creek, Westmoreland county, Va., in 1718, and died at his residence, Mount Vernon, 26th July, 1752. He was the half-brother of the illustrious George Washington and great-grandson of the emigrant, Col. John Washington, who came to Virginia [53]about 1657. It is a matter of tradition that Lawrence was at about the age of 15 sent to England to be educated, and leaving college he received a captain's commission to serve in a regiment raised in Virginia to take part in the expedition against Carthegenia, 1740-42, under the command of Admiral Vernon.
The expedition failed of its purpose, and Major Lawrence Washington returned to Virginia in the fall of 1742. He shortly after became engaged to Anne Fairfax, which induced him to resign from the army. His father died April 12, 1743, leaving a considerable estate and named him, his oldest son, one of his executors. He inherited from his father "the Hunting creek" plantation, consisting of 2,500 acres, on the Potomac but a few miles from and in sight of "Belvoir." On the 19th of July Lawrence Washington was united in marriage to Anne, eldest daughter of the Hon. William Fairfax of "Belvoir." He made many improvements on his plantation and gave it the name of "Mount Vernon," in compliment to his old commander, Admiral Vernon. Lawrence Washington had received a good education, had mixed with prominent personages, had seen much of the world, and was a man of good habits and business qualifications.
His father at the time of his death, was largely engaged in business which Lawrence was obliged to look after and close up. This gradually led him into various business enterprises; such as the manufacturing of iron, buying and selling land, etc. He and his brother Augustin were among the organizers of "The Ohio Company," to explore the western country, encourage settlements, and conduct a trade with the Indians. He was elected to the House of Burgesses of Virginia from Fairfax county in 1748. It was largely through his influence that a charter was granted to the towns of Alexandria and Colchester, both in Fairfax county. He together with Lord Fairfax, George Mason, Hon. William Fairfax, William Ramsay, John Carlyle and others was named as trustee to lay out and govern the town. He was a popular legislator, but declined to serve longer in the Assembly, as it interfered with his present business. He was greatly attached to his brother George, and made it a point to have him with him at Mount Vernon whenever it was practicable without interrupting his studies. Lawrence was always of a delicate constitution, but by his prudent habits and systematic[54] attention to business he accomplished a great deal and enhanced the value of his possessions. He was tall in stature and a man of fine personal appearance, as is shown by an oil painting of him which still hangs upon the wall of the Virginia room in Mount Vernon mansion. He was rapidly becoming one of the leading business men of Virginia, when his health broke down. As a last resort his physicians recommended that he should spend a winter in the West Indies. In the fall of 1751, he resigned his commission as one of the adjutant-generals of Virginia, and taking his brother George with him, he went to the Island of Barbadoes. His pulmonary trouble had progressed too far to be arrested, and after spending some five months on the Island, and finding himself declining he returned home and died in July, 1752. His marriage had been blessed by four children, three of whom had died, his surviving child, Sarah, was still an infant at the time of her father's death. After providing in his will for his wife he left Mount Vernon to his daughter, but in the event of her death without heirs it was to go to his "beloved brother George," who was also named as one of his executors. This daughter Sarah died within a year, and George inherited Mount Vernon before he was 21 years of age. A few years after Lawrence Washington's death, his widow married George Lee, brother to the father of Arthur and Richard Henry Lee, patriots in the Revolution.
[45] The note book which contains this journal of Washington's includes also other memoranda, such as notes of surveys, drafts of juvenile letters, verses, etc., all of which are of interest for the glimpses they give of the character and early life of their author, and are copied with literal exactness and given with the journal and surveys.

[46] Frederick county, Virginia, was formed by Act of Assembly in 1738, out of Orange county at the same time that Augusta county was created. The boundaries of Frederick county were measurably well defined; to Augusta, however, was left all the western territory belonging to Virginia, much of it at that time an unexplored wilderness. This immense area has since been divided and now forms four great and independent states of the Union, namely, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois. Frederick county, by a return of the effective militia made to the governor of Virginia in 1777, had but 923 men. The total population of the town of Winchester at that time was 800 and a fraction.—Kercheval.

[47] At this place in the journal three leaves, six pages, have been torn out. The edges left show that they had been written upon by Washington. The next record of a survey in the hand-writing of Washington is signed by him with the name of James Genn, as is also the incomplete plot of a survey here reproduced from the original by tracing; whether it is a study from field notes by James Genn or an actual survey by Washington himself does not appear. The paper upon which it is drawn and the style of the hand-writing, place it as of a date current with the added records of 1747-8.

It is probable that these lines were run in the winter when the river was closed with ice.

Dear Sir
I should receive a Letter or Letters from you by the first and all oppertunetys with the greatest sense or mark of your esteem and affection whereas its the greatest Pleasure I can yet forsee of having in fairfax to hear from my Intimate friends and acquaintances I hope you in Particular will not Bauk me of what I so ardently Wish for[49]
[49] This appears to have been a study for a letter to some youthful companion. Even to the close of his life it was the habit of Washington, in writing important letters and papers, to make rough drafts of them as a study. However, in copying them off, he frequently changed expressions and amplified their contents as his judgment approved. The original drafts of many of his letters are preserved in the Department of State at Washington and illustrate this fact. Hence the transcripts in his letter-book are not always true copies of either his drafts or his original autograph letters. These drafts were kept by him as memoranda, rather than as exact copies. It is also probable that there are many drafts preserved of letters which were never actually sent. In some cases he endorses this fact upon drafts of letters.
Dear Friend John[50]
As its the greatest mark of friendship and esteem you can shew to an absent Friend In often Writing[58] to him so hope you'l not deny me that Favour as its so ardently wish'd and desired by me its the greatest pleasure I can yet forsee of having in fairfax to hear from my friends Particularly yourself was my affections disengaged I might perhaps form some pleasures in the conversasion of an agreeable Young Lady as theres one now Lives in the same house with me but as that is only nourishment to my former affecn for by often seeing her brings the other into my remembrance whereas perhaps was she not often &amp; (unavoidably) presenting herself to my view I might in some measure eliviate my sorrows by burying the other in the grave of Oblivion I am well convinced my heart stands in defiance of all others but only she thats given it cause enough to dread a second assault and from a different Quarter tho I well know let it have as many attacks as it will from others they cant be more fierce than it has been I could wish to know whether you have taken your intended trip downwards or not if you with what Success as also to know how my friend Lawrence drives on in his art of courtship as I fancy you may both nearlly guess how it will respectively go with each of you
[50] Dear Sir, Dear Friend John, and Dear Friend Robin.—These all seem to be studies or drafts of letters, which may have been impersonal or possibly to his youthful school-fellows and companions in Westmoreland and Stafford counties. It would be idle to speculate as to whom they were intended, in the absence of more definite information. They are in no wise remarkable, except as evidences of Washington's life-long habit of making memoranda, drafts and studies of his letters.
[59]
Dear Friend Robin
As its the greatest mark of friendship and esteem absent Friends can shew each other in Writing and often communicating their thoughts to his fellow companions makes me endeavour to signalize myself in acquainting you from time to time and at all times my situation and employments of Life and could Wish you would take half the Pains of contriving me a Letter by any oppertunity as you may be well assured of its meeting with a very welcome reception my Place of Residence is at present at His Lordships where I might was my heart disengag'd pass my time very pleasantly as theres a very agreeable Young Lady Lives in the same house (Colo George Fairfax's Wife's Sister[51]) but as thats only adding Fuel to fire it makes me the more uneasy for by often and unavoidably being in Company with her revives my former Passion for your Low Land Beauty[52] whereas was I to live more retired from yound Women I might in some measure eliviate my sorrows by burying that chast and troublesome Passion in the grave of oblivion or etarnall forgetfulness for as I am very well assured thats the only antidote or remedy that I ever shall be releivd by or only recess that can administer any cure or help to me as I am well convinced was I ever to attempt any thing I should only get a denial which would be only adding grief to uneasiness
[51] The young lady indicated was Miss Mary Cary, the daughter of Colonel Wilson Cary, of Ceeleys Hampton, Elisabeth City county, Va. For 34 years Mr. Cary was collector of customs[60] for the lower James river district, and a man of large wealth and aristocratic notions. He had four daughters: Sarah, who married George W. Fairfax, of "Belvoir"; Mary, who married in 1754, Edward Ambler of Jamestown; Anna, who married Robert Carter Nicholas; and Elizabeth, who married Rev. Bryan, 8th Lord Fairfax. Col. Cary had also one son Wilson Miles Cary, who was a member of the Convention of Virginia in 1776. Some writers have confounded him with his father. Bishop Meade in his Old Churches and Families of Virginia, accepts traditions which other writers claim are authenticated by documents, preserved by the Ambler family, and accordingly his account credits the story that Washington, in his youth, was an ardent admirer of Miss Mary Cary, and solicited leave of Col. Cary to address his daughter, but was refused. (See Meade, vol. i, 108.) This draft of the letter addressed to "Dear Friend Robin," was probably made in the spring of 1748, when Washington was in his seventeenth year. In it, he playfully avows an admiration for the "lowland beauty" and, at the same time, admits the agreeableness of the "young lady in the house" with him at "Belvoir." Mr. Edward Ambler, educated at Cambridge, England, was collector for York river and a burgess for Jamestown. He died in 1768 in his thirty-fifth year and was buried at Jamestown; his widow survived him until 1781. Mrs. Ambler with her children and her sister, Mrs. Fairfax, were occasionally guests at Mount Vernon, as Washington's diaries show. I am inclined to believe that while it is true that Washington entertained a high regard for the Cary family and particularly the ladies, there is nothing but the lightest gossip to create an inference that there ever was even an incipient affair of the heart between either of the Misses Cary and Washington.
[52] Lowland beauty.—Who this object of Washington's early admiration was, if she had a veritable existence, is not positively known. Irving, followed by Everett and others, accepts the tradition, or rather surmises, that this sobriquet referred to Miss Lucy Grymes of Westmoreland county, who in 1753 married Henry Lee, Esq. Their son was the gallant General Henry Lee, "Lighthorse Harry," of the Revolution. Some recent writers, affect to believe that this draft of a letter is conclusive that there was a real love affair but that Betsy[61] Fauntleroy, of Fredericksburg, Va., was the person referred to, and have published a letter purporting to have been addressed by Washington to William Fauntleroy, Sr., Esq., in Richmond, enclosing one to Miss Betsy, who, it is made to appear, had also refused Washington's addresses. Letters and traditions of this character should be received with caution, for while vague reports and surmises of an affair of the heart may be dilated upon in a bantering way among friends of the parties where there is little or no foundation for the allegation, yet they should be subjected to scrutiny and some positive evidence adduced before they are accepted as historical facts.
Dear Sally
This comes to Fredericksburg fair in hopes of meeting with a speedy Passage to you if your not there which hope you'l get shortly altho I am almost discouraged from writing to you as this is my fouth to you since I receiv'd any from yourself I hope you'l not make the Old Proverb good out of sight out of Mind as its one of the greatest Pleasures I can yet foresee of having in Fairfax in often hearing from you hope you'l not deny it me

[53] The minuteness of detail is very characteristic of the writer. While Washington was observant of the proprieties of life and of good taste in dress, there was not the least leaning to foppishness. But it was a principle with him to have whatever he bought, consonant with good taste and of the best quality.
[54] At this point in the book there are 18 blank pages.
Dear Richard
The Receipt of your kind favour of the 2d of this Instant afforded me unspeakable pleasure as I am convinced I am still in the Memory of so Worthy a friend a friendship I shall ever be proud of Increasing you gave me the more pleasure as I receiv'd it amongst a parcel of Barbarians and an uncooth set of People the like favour often repeated would give me Pleasure[63] altho I seem to be in a Place where no real satis: is to be had since you receid my Letter in October Last I have not sleep'd above three Nights or four in a bed but after Walking a good deal all the Day lay down before the fire upon a Little Hay Straw Fodder or bearskin whichever is to be had with Man Wife and Children like a Parcel of Dogs or Catts &amp; happy's he that gets the Birth nearest the fire there's nothing would make it pass of tolerably but a good Reward a Dubbleloon is my constant gain every Day that the Weather will permit my going out and some time Six Pistoles[55] the coldness of the Weather will not allow my making a long stay as the Lodging is rather too cold for the time of Year I have never had my Cloths of but lay and sleep in them like a Negro except the few Nights I have lay'n in Frederick Town.

Mem To Survey the Lands at the Mouth of Little Cacapehon[56] &amp; the Mouth of Fifteen Mile Creek[57] for the Gentlemen of the Ohio Com:[58]
[56] Cacapehon, now generally written Capon.—There are two streams in the same vicinity known by this name, and to distinguish them, one is called "Great Capon" and the other "Little Capon." Both are tributaries to the Potomac.
[57] Fifteen Mile creek rises in Maryland and flows in a south-easterly direction, emptying into the Potomac river between Sideling Hill creek and Town creek, about 15 miles above Hancock, Md.
[64]
[58] "The Ohio Company" grew into existence out of efforts by Virginians, dated as early as 1746 or 1747, to secure a share in the lucrative Indian trade, and with the prospect of opening to settlement the lands on the upper waters of the Ohio. An early move in this direction had been made by Colonel Thomas Cresap, a man of courage, judgment and enterprise—qualities required for trading successfully with the Indians. He had erected his cabin at Oldtown, Md. About 1746 Lawrence and Augustine Washington, after making some cautious business ventures in the Indian trade, with others assisted to organize "this Ohio Company." Thomas Lee, whose second son, Richard Henry Lee, was to become so conspicuous a patriot of the Revolution, and John Hanbury, a wealthy London merchant, were original members of this company, into which still other men of substance and standing were admitted, and to which, in 1749, the British government gave a charter, as "The Ohio Company," with a grant of half a million acres of land, to be located between the Monongahela and Kanawha rivers, on the south side of the Ohio. With but twenty shares of stock at first issue, the company's prosperity seemed assured, and both Governor Dinwiddie and George Mason, at a later date purchased an interest in it. Among the early Washington manuscripts appears the above memorandum of a survey for this company. Although this entry is without date it must have been earlier, judging from its position in the note-book, than the charter. This document imposed, as conditions of the land grant, that the company should at once survey two hundred thousand acres, and within seven years secure the settlement of not less than one hundred families, erect forts, and maintain a garrison against the Indians,—conditions on the fulfilment of which they were to be for ten years exempt from the payment of quit-rents. Mr. Christopher Gist was employed as the company's agent, and on October 19, 1749, entered upon his duties of inspecting the country, contiguous to the Ohio river, reporting upon the character of the lands, making surveys, keeping a journal of his observations, drawing plans of the territory, etc. In 1750 the company built a small store-house at Will's creek and stocked it with goods from London to the value of £4,000. In 1752 Mr. Gist held a council with the Indians on the Ohio in behalf of the company, and secured their permission to lay out a town and erect a fort at McKee's[65] Rocks at the mouth of Chartier's creek, upon the east side of the Ohio, a few miles below Pittsburg. Washington, in his diary, alludes to this, and says of the position: "I think it greatly inferior, either for defense or advantage, especially the latter: For a fort at the forks would be equally well situated on the Ohio, and have the entire command of the Monongahela." In 1751 the company began making a road to the mouth of the Monongahela, but for lack of adequate resources, made only slow progress. The company looked upon the lands around Will's creek as being within their grant. They also erected a store-house at the mouth of Redstone on the Monongahela and began some improvements at the forks of the Ohio, immediately after completing those at Will's creek. At the latter place they had the adjacent lands surveyed on both sides the stream, above and below the forks, and laid out a town to which they gave the name of Charlottesburg in honor of the Princess Charlotte, afterward wife of King George. The French and Indian war, with other stirring political events, compelled the company to be cautious and to contract its operations, but, its embarrassments increasing from the course pursued toward it by the English government, prompted by envious rival interests, the consent of its agent, George Mercer, Esq., was finally gained to merge the Ohio Company into a Grand Company, under what was known as the Walpole Grant or Company. Their proposal was as follows: "We, the Committee of the Purchasers of a Tract of Country for a new Province on the Ohio in America, do hereby admit the Ohio Company as a Co-Purchaser with us for two shares of the said Purchase,* in Consideration of the Engagement of their Agent, Col. Mercer, to withdraw the application of the said Company for a separate Grant within the Limits of the said Purchase.
Witness our Hands this 7th Day of May 1770
* The whole being divided into seventy-two equal Shares by the words "two shares" above is understood two Seventy-second parts of the Tract so as above Purchased.

[59] Memorandum or draft of a letter to his sister-in-law Anne, wife of Lawrence Washington, of Mount Vernon, made, very possibly, while in the field surveying in the fall of 1748 or spring of 1749. This visit to Europe, of Lawrence Washington, was partly in the interest of the Ohio Company and partly on account of his failing health which, unfortunately, was not benefited by the voyage as had been hoped.

[60] Mrs. Aus. Washington evidently refers to Mrs. Augustine Washington, of Westmoreland, the wife of George's half-brother, Augustine, with whom he had made his home while attending Mr. William's Academy. Austin is, or has been, in Virginia a contraction for Augustine. Augustine Moore, a notable character, is recorded interchangeably, in land and other records, as Augustine and as Austin Moore. It is presumed that "The Maryland Housewife" was intended to have been written, that being the name of a popular book on cookery and the art of housekeeping at that period. The date of this memorandum[67] is presumed to be 1748. A charge in his book of accounts kept at this time, and which was among the relics of Lawrence Washington sold in Philadelphia in the spring of 1891, would fix the date as July 28th, 1748. It was not an unusual thing for Washington in his youth to use contractions in writing the first names of his brothers, the following are examples: Aus., Austin for Augustine; Sam for Samuel; Jack and John, simply for John Augustine.

[61] This is about the only record Washington has left of his course of reading. It is inferred that the books were either at "Greenway Court" or at "Belvoir." The character of the works he selected for his perusal is what might have been expected. This memorandum also exhibits a trait in his character prominent throughout his life, that of giving attention to minute details of business. It may truly be said of him that "the boy was father to the man."
[62] Honorable William Fairfax, of "Belvoir," Fairfax county, Va., was born 1691 in Yorkshire, England, where his father that year became high sheriff of the county. His father was the son of Henry Fairfax, 2d son of 4th Lord Fairfax and Anna (Harrison) Fairfax, whose sister, Eleanora Harrison, of South Cave, married in 1689, Henry Washington; their son, Richard Washington, who resided in London, was, therefore, an English cousin of Wm. Fairfax, and a correspondent both of his and of Col. George Washington's (see Washington's correspondence,[68] in Sparks). Wm. Fairfax lost his father when quite young and was educated at his uncle's, Sir John Lowther's College. Through the influence of Capt. Fairfax, of the Royal Navy, he entered that service in 1710 and served for two years. He then joined the British army in Spain under Col. Martin Bladen, who had married a Fairfax, and was stationed at St. Helena in 1716-17, and subsequently at the Bahamas, and returned to England in October, 1717. Having married in the Bahamas, Sarah, daughter of Maj. Walker, of Nassau, she accompanied him to England. In 1718 Wm. Fairfax was sent out with Captain or Governor Woodes Rogers as chief justice to suppress the pirates infesting the West Indies. His residence was at Nassau, New Providence. The business for which he accepted office having been completed and the climate not being congenial, he in 1725 removed to New England. Here he received an appointment to the custom house at Salem, which he held until 1734. While a resident of Salem, his first wife died and was buried there. His son George William was born in Nassau, three of his children were born in Salem. Thomas, of the Royal Navy, was killed in battle; Anne married Lawrence Washington, and was the first mistress of Mount Vernon; and Sarah married John Carlyle, of Alexandria, Va., who was a major and commissary in the French and Indian war. Mr. Fairfax married, January 18, 1731, Deborah Clarke, of Salem, Mass. Her first child was Bryan, 8th Lord Fairfax, born at Salem 1732, but better known as the Rev. Bryan Fairfax, who died in 1802. In 1734 Wm. Fairfax accepted an offer, he had before declined, to remove to Virginia and act as agent for his cousin, Lord Thomas Fairfax, in the management of the vast Fairfax land estate. He at first took up his residence in Westmoreland county and remained there for several years, but afterward improved the plantation, built "Belvoir" mansion, six miles below "Mount Vernon," and removed to it. He was residing there in 1739, when Lord Fairfax first visited Virginia and made it his home for a year. Wm. Fairfax, from his high character and acquaintance with business, soon came to the front among the leading men in Virginia. Besides being agent for his cousin, he served in the assembly of Virginia, and after the death of John Blair was president of the Provincial council and collector of his majesty's customs for the South Potomac. His second wife bore him two children, besides Bryan[69] already mentioned, William Henry, killed at the storming of Quebec in 1759; and Hannah, who married Warner Washington, cousin to George Washington. William Fairfax was a man of great executive ability and much beloved by the community. He died September 3, 1757. His wife survived him but a few years. "Belvoir" was left to George W. Fairfax and was his residence until he went to England in 1773.

[63] The razor in colonial days was an essential part of a gentleman's toilet outfit. Washington had a strong beard and was early called upon to use his razor. Long, full beards were not then in fashion in America. It is a notable fact that there is not a portrait extant of an American-born patriot or statesman of the Revolutionary period, painted with a full beard. This memorandum, although not dated, is believed to have been written in 1748. The clean shaven face was constrained by the fashion of the continent; and prevailed as the custom in England and France for a period of quite 75 years.

[65] A kind of shirt collar.
[66] Neck Cloths.—These were usually made of fine white cambric, folded wide, were wrapped twice around the neck and worn without collars.
[67] Caps.—The number here will attract attention considering the list of other articles; but it must be remembered that it was the custom at that period for both men and women to wear caps at night in bed. At the time when this journal was written,[70] bed rooms were not heated, hence the custom of warming beds before retiring in winter, and the necessity for wearing night caps is more apparent, and, further, the head was frequently shaven and wigs were worn during the day by many. It is the tradition that Patrick Henry wore at home, in the day, even, when not in full dress, a "tarred cotton cap," whilst in public he wore a wig. In speaking, when he was earnestly moved, a striking emphasis of his is said to have been a rapid whirling of his wig around his head.

Oh Ye Gods why should my Poor Resistless Heart
Stand to oppose thy might and Power
At Last surrender to cupids feather'd Dart
And now lays Bleeding every Hour
For her that's Pityless of my grief and Woes
And will not on me Pity take

And with gladness never wish to wake
In deluding sleepings let my Eyelids close

In a soft lulling sleep and gentle repose
Possess those joys denied by Day

[70] Land warrants were granted by the Crown, by the Legislature or its authorized agent, and by the governors of the provinces. A warrant had the character of a commission and guaranteed title. Land warrants issued in accordance with law were negotiable, and when laid and the survey plotted by a licensed surveyor and recorded in the land office, were maintained by the courts as against all other claimants.
The following is an exact copy of an order from G. W. Fairfax, agent of Lord Fairfax, for the sale of unseated lands in the "Northern Neck of Virginia" to George Washington a licensed surveyor in Virginia as his warrant to survey a particular parcel of land. The original document was in the possession of J. A. Russell, Esq., of New York city, in 1869, and is published in the Historical Magazine for March of that year, p. 197:—
"To Mr. G. Washington
"Whereas, Barthalamore Anderson, of Frederick County hath Informed that there are about Four hundred 50 Acres of Waste and Ungranted Land in the said County, formerly granted to Thomas Morgan by Jost Hite as p. Bond for the same &amp; by Assignment to the sd Anderson, on Arnold's Run a branch of Shenandoah.
"And Desiring a Warrant to survey the same in order to obtain a Deed, being ready to Pay the Composition and Office Charges.
"These are therefore to Empower You the sd G. Washington to survey the sd Waste Land.
"Provided this be the first Warrant that hath Issued for the same and you are to make a just, true and Acurate survey [73]thereof, Describing the courses and distances p. Pole, also the Buttings and Boundings of the several Persons Lands adjoining, and where you cannot Join on any known Lines, you are to make Breadth of the tract to bear at least the proportion of one-third part of the length as the Law of Virginia Directs, you are also to Insert the Names of the Pilot and Chain Carriers made use of and Employed, a Plat of which sd Survey with this Warrant you are to give into this Office any time before the twenty-fifth Day of March next ensuing.

[71] Lost River.—This stream gets its name from the fact that for three miles it passes out of sight under a mountain which lies across its course. It rises in Hardy county, W. Va., and flows in a north-easterly direction to the Cacapehon river. The following diagram is made from a pen drawing by Washington in his field note book, but not definitely related to this particular survey.
 
Cacapehon or lost River
My Lord
I went Last Tuesday not knowing your Lordship had that very Day set out for Neavils to see whether you had any further Commands or directions to give concerning the Surveying of Cacapehon and as your Lordship was not at Home I was inform by Colo G. Fairfax that you had not any Directions in Particular more than were given to the other Surveyors as your Lordship had mentioned I therefore have made bold to Proceed on General Directions from him as[74] Missing this Opportunity of Good Weather may be of considerable Hindrance I shall Wait on your Lordship at Frederick Court in November to obey your further Pleasure and am my Lord &amp;[72]
[72] Here terminates the entries in the little note book, containing "My Journey Over the Mountains." It is proper to state that the journal was kept in a small, vellum-bound, blank book, 6 by 3¾ inches in size, closely written on both sides of the leaf. Either from a desire to classify his memoranda, or for want of a second book, or from some motive of economy, he turned the book around and began from the other end to keep a record more particularly relating to his surveys and miscellaneous affairs. His field notes of surveys were kept in a book of the same size as the one described, from which the most of the following surveys are taken. The other surveys are found on loose sheets which have been bound and denominated miscellaneous papers; a few of them having dates, enables the editor to place them in chronological order.

[75] For this survey Washington received the sum of £2 3s 0d on the 25th of July, 1749, as shown by entry in his cash book; a copy of which is in the Toner Collection, Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.
[76] Culpeper county, Virginia, was formed by act of assembly in 1748, and named in honor of Lord Thomas Culpeper, governor of Virginia from 1682 to 1686. The old family name was spelled with two p's, but in using the name as a locality one p is dropped. Its original form, however, was Colepeper. The widow of Lord Culpeper spelled her name and wrote it, "Mar. Culpeper—Leeds Castle, Dec. 19, 1706." Lord Culpeper and Lord Arlington had obtained from Charles II in 1672 a grant of proprietary rights over the whole of Virginia, but within a short time, in consequence of resistance by the colonists, surrendered all except quit rents and escheats, and a duty of three half-pence per pound on tobacco. Two years after ceasing to be governor, Lord Culpeper, who had become by purchase sole owner of the grant, further abandoned all his rights except that of property in the lands of that part of the Northern Neck beyond the Blue Ridge, with an annual pension of £600 for twenty years in lieu of what he gave up. This estate of about 5,700,000 acres of land in the Shenandoah valley and the mountains beyond, went to his daughter and heiress, Catherine, who became the wife of Thomas, the 5th Lord Fairfax, and from her to their son Thomas the 6th, and the first American Lord Fairfax of Washington's time. Lord Culpeper had been one of the commissioners of plantations under Charles II, and was a man of ability for business and public affairs, although rapacious; and, as governor, wholly British, without that sympathy for Virginia interest, such as Berkeley, with all his faults, had shown. The county of Culpeper, however, was conspicuous for the patriotism of its inhabitants during the Revolution. Her "minute men," Randolph said on the floor of the United States Senate, "were raised in a minute, armed in a minute, marched in a minute, fought in a minute, and vanquished in a minute." The motto on their flag was, "The Culpeper Minute Men," along the top border; in the center a curled rattlesnake with head erect and rattling tail; on either side the words "Liberty—or Death;" and beneath, along the lower border, "Don't [78] Tread on Me." In the clerk's office of Culpeper court house is recorded the following: "20 July, 1749 [O. S.] George Washington, Gent., produced a commission from the President and Master of William and Mary College, appointing him to be surveyor of this county, which was read, and thereupon he took the usual oaths," etc.
[77] Washington, S. C. C.—This is supposed to be an official check mark signature of George Washington as a licensed surveyor of Culpeper county. The plat of this survey is published by Sparks, vol. 1, p. 14, and is reproduced here, as the editor has failed, so far, in finding the original among any of the Washington papers extant. The plat bears date two days after he filed his certificate and took the necessary oath before the court in Culpeper county referred to in the preceding note.

[78] Augusta county, and also Frederick county, were formed in 1738, out of Orange county which, prior to that date, had embraced all of Virginia beyond the Blue Ridge. The bounds of Frederick were defined as follows: the Potomac on the north, the Blue Ridge on the east, and on the south and west a line drawn from the head spring of the Hedgman creek to the head spring of the Potomac; all beyond this line, comprising the immense western territory belonging to Virginia, constituted Augusta county. The earliest Frederick county court was held at Winchester, Nov. 11, 1743; and that of Augusta county was held at Beverley's Mill Place, now Staunton, Dec. 9, 1745.
[79] The notes of the survey of land, on the 22d July, 1749, for Richard Barnes, and that of November 12, 1749, for Edward Hogan, were recorded on sheets of foolscap paper, and are bound up with other early miscellaneous papers of George Washington, preserved in the Department of State. They are here given nearly in their chronological place.

It is situated a couple of miles above the forks of Capon.

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

### Blood Knight

"...HAVE AT THEE!"

Fighting is everything to the Blood Knight. He *lives* for it. It's not so much about winning or losing, morality, the motives of his allies, or even [the glory][8YZ36INZ], that drives this guy so much as it is the opportunity for a good fight.

A Blood Knight can be of any morality whatsoever, although [Anti Heroes][u0ObArmO] and [Anti Villains][T1JTqSvg] tend to be most common.

Heroic examples will frequently be [The Big Guy][5AO8omI0] in an ensemble, the character most likely to solve his problems by force of arms. They might make the less violent members of the crew a little nervous, especially if they go off on a [hair trigger][Owwr10io]. He may merely enjoy the challenge and not hurting others necessarily; some don't hurt people unprovoked since they have a sense of right and wrong.

The Blood Knight doesn't even have to be a particularly violent man most of the time. A common version found in Eastern fiction is the Wandering Martial Artist, who [Wanders the Earth][6n9nyaLq] looking for strong opponents to test his skills against. This might be coupled with a love of fair duels and a desire to [challenge][7dnaJisw] the [best and strongest][lrtGZFKZ]. This type still enjoys the thrill of the fight, but usually eschews the death and bloodshed aspect. A living opponent, after all, can improve their skills and provide an even better challenge later. [Defeat Means Friendship][NTCSooGt] is a common occurrence with these guys, their opponent's or their own.

As an antagonist, he has a good chance of being an [Anti-Villain][T1JTqSvg], since he doesn't want to kill the heroes, necessarily, just fight them. If he can find someone [tough enough to beat him][NTCSooGt] he might undergo a [Heel–Face Turn][4ddyN6KV] and join the hero's team, or simply gain a [newfound respect][n7LzcJdO] for his foe that he [didn't have before][xSMzlNtw]. He might deliberately disadvantage himself in order to make fights last longer and loves to reveal that [he is not left-handed][w3ZnU22j]. Despite the brutality that this trope implies, it's not uncommon for them to be a [Noble Demon][1iLD0xRO] as well when they want an exciting fight on *specific terms* or when they reject unfair advantages because it would make the fight no fun. He may even betray his boss if he insists on interfering to [pursue and obsess][lBfukRYT] over his [foe][B9FcHDEW] on his own terms. Less pleasant ones may [do all kinds of horrible things][fySftJb4] to provoke their opponents into fighting them. Though if they specifically love to kill (rather than fight) they are a [Psycho for Hire][ffygDGaN].

Personality-wise, more evil ones may be a [Flat Character][I8c8GuS9] (and quite possibly [The Brute][JMPoKDNg]) who just shouts ["Maim! Kill! Burn!"][G4RmY0dD]. Good/[Sympathetic][T1JTqSvg] ones are usually more sophisticated/developed and can have aspects of the [Warrior Therapist][HLHEVKhg], [Warrior Poet][lMZ37H5w] or [Cultured Warrior][VpmxUQ6I]. He might be a [normal, jocular guy][jJapQwqJ] when he's not brawling, or he might take the fight so seriously that [he blocks out everything else][m6t0OFPg] and will therefore live only for battle. In some cases, the Blood Knight fights because he's [looking for a way to die with meaning][nQOjGvHQ].

A [War God][T3JPzWrI] is very often one of these though he could also be [Ax-Crazy][7zRo270J] or just [The Sociopath][yKKrXD8t]. If there's a whole society of guys who like combat, you've got a [Proud Warrior Race][iJeuyt4b]. If the character likes the 'killing' part more than the 'fighting' part, they're a [Psycho for Hire][ffygDGaN]. The [Egomaniac Hunter][EisKT81j] also thrives on aimless violent thrill and loves a worthy quarry instead of an opponent. If a character is in it for the challenge rather than just the fight, then we've got a [Spirited Competitor][lrtGZFKZ]. The Blood Knight's love of combat may be platonic, or it may have [sexual undertones][fCDTWkPw]. It could also overlap with [Ax-Crazy][7zRo270J] if their love of fighting crosses the line into psychopathic violence and mental and emotional instability.

[Sub-Trope][mQM4b4iB] of [In Harm's Way][xtbR5r4W]. [Sister Trope][OYSiT6UH] to [Combat Sadomasochist][bCT1i3MP], [The Real Man][QD2QFNfT], and [Boisterous Bruiser][jJapQwqJ]. Compare [Cavalier Competitor][i6ocNpLN] and, for a more general trope, [Challenge Seeker][7dnaJisw]. Also compare [Sadist][OFUvPqWd], whose favorite part of fighting is the pain and suffering of his opponent. May be from a [Martyrdom Culture][2rTfKSTe] and will nearly always believe that [War Is Glorious][yyS5CV3Y]. If he (or she, though it's much rarer, however; see [Lady of War][KJTy7GmN]) is in the military, then he will almost inevitably be a [Colonel Kilgore][tJ2lki0n]. A [Monster Knight][aXYfXuSP] has a high chance of being one. A more violent example that nonetheless fights on the side of good may (or may not) be a [Sociopathic Hero][OasPdJsM]. It also has [nothing to do with][icrOJad4] a knight who uses [Blood Magic][TsBq59Ah]. Contrast [Shell-Shocked Veteran][Kst7SKRY], who is of the opposite mindset (also contrast [War Is Hell][YlxlrGDi]).

Oh, just in case it wasn't clear, the character doesn't have to be a literal knight for this trope to apply. It is about the attitude, not the rank.

#### Blood Knight / Playing With

**Basic Trope**: Someone who enjoys fighting.

- **Straight**: Bob loves a good fight and picks a profession that allows him to seek out worthy opponents and enjoys proving his skills against them in battle.
- **Exaggerated**:
    - Bob cannot go a week without getting into some kind of fight just to alleviate boredom if nothing else.
    - Bob starts a religion where brutally murdering your enemy is the best way for his salvation. And for the salvation of his enemies. Or Bob uses elements of "sacred sexuality" like in Tantrism, but replaces everything sexual with the joy of killing his enemies.
- **Downplayed**: Bob enjoys fighting against skilled opponents, but doesn't go out of his way to seek them out.
- **Justified**:
    - As a member of a militaristic culture that glorified warfare and prowess of the battlefield, Bob is merely acting according to his culture's expectations of a good warrior.
    - He started out his [rampage as a revenge][rsGAjpSu], but in the end, he ended up obsessed with fighting.
    - He spills the others' blood [to ease his thirst][sjsLrNzh]. And since nutrition is a pleasure on itself...
    - Combat provides a *massive* adrenaline rush. Bob fights to get the ultimate high.
- **Subverted**: Bob enjoys proving his skill on the battlefield until he meets an opponent that grossly outclasses him in terms of skill. He then finds that fighting is less fun when you're getting your ass kicked.
- **Double Subverted**: Bob's beatdown motivates him to train harder so he can defeat his opponent.
- **Parodied**: Everytime Bob hears about a fight, he immediately goes berserk and runs at the place to start yelling "KILLBURNKILL!!!" and swinging the first heavy object he found and picked up left and right.
- **Zig Zagged**: Whether or not Bob is enjoying a fight depends on a variety of factors, sometimes he's having the time of his life, other times he's just as stressed as everyone else.
- **Averted**: Bob may be a warrior, but he doesn't enjoy fighting in the slightest
- **Enforced**:
    - The writer wants to portray the negative aspects of being obsessed with violence.
    - The writer finds "he goes looking for fights" more realistic as a plot device than "[all the fights come to him][4ni2cnVd]".
- **Implied**: Whenever Bob is in open combat, he seems much more relaxed than in everyday situations.
- **Lampshaded**:
    - "It's been like four days since anybody needed me to punch them. [I. Am. So. BORED.][y3xgDG8B]"
    - "Doesn't he have another fun in his life?"
- **Invoked**: Bob was [raised from birth][zZCFcecU] to love fighting and violence so that he could serve as [The Heavy][AAyI6Lth] for the local [Big Bad][fHDZdx4L].
- **Exploited**: Bob is easy to manipulate, because his love of fighting gets in the way of his critical thinking when it comes to things like "Should I be fighting this guy in the first place?"
- **Defied**: Bob isn't hesitant about fighting when it's necessary, but refuses to let it become something he enjoys for its own sake.
- **Discussed**: "If there's anything I've learned, [Enyo][TMDVGMzX], it's that if you show yourself to be strong, you'll have people lining up to fight. Thus, I want everyone to know how strong you are, so I can find a few combat-addicts to help further defend my plans."
- **Conversed**: "People who like fighting are always written as battle-lusty maniacs — as in, literally, they all but cum in battle, and in an X-rated show they go *that* far, too. It's always like that. You'd think writers would give them a bit more nuance nowadays."
- **Deconstructed**:
    - Bob's tendencies to seek out worthy opponents leads to him getting killed.
    - Bob's love of battle leads him to escalate a situation that could have easily been defused peacefully. He is abandoned by his comrades after the destruction his actions indirectly caused.
    - The person he fights for publically begs him to stop fighting.
- **Reconstructed**:
    - Bob knows his aggressive tendencies put him at risk of doing something stupid, so he emphasizes self-control and learns to enjoy his moments of delayed gratification.
    - Bob is a [Martial Pacifist][6eS4ebwl] who deeply enjoys fighting, but also knows that there is a time and place for it.
    - In the end, Bob loses everything, he gets ostracised by everyone he wanted to defend, gets betrayed and outright killed. Hundred years later, even his enemies consider him a hero because he fought for what he believed, no matter the cost, and risked everything for his values.
- **Played For Laughs**: Bob treats fighting like any other form of entertainment. When everyone goes to the cinema, he goes to the boxing club, and going to war is his idea of a perfect vacation.
- **Played For Drama**:
    - Bob can seldom find any enjoyment in anything other than combat. Despite having been injured multiple times and being ridden by guilt over the times he had to kill someone, he continues to do the only thing that, in his opinion, makes his life worth living.
    - Bob is a [Death Seeker][nIZKOig7] [who can't commit suicide][QKuWKe0c] because it would be [dishonorable][jPFZD177]. Therefore he tries to find [someone who can kill him in a fight][Ua9xr2he].
- **Played For Horror**: Bob is shown laughing with joy, while his fallen enemies scream in pain at his feet.

Archaeology[edit]
Since the first white settlement of Juniata County, the area now named the Book Site has been known as a location of prehistoric interest; local tradition held that it was once occupied by an Indian fort. By the middle of the nineteenth century, skeletons were being removed from the mound as the result of cultivation, and individuals periodically dug in the mound into the 1920s. A professional investigation of the site was conducted in the summer and autumn of 1929; the archaeologists discovered a wide range of pottery, many projectile points, and a large number of bones, including twenty-two skulls.[2]:2 The combination of artifacts and the site's location slightly above a large stream have led to its identification as a work of the Clemson Island culture[2]:3 (AD 700-1300)[3] during the early Late Woodland period.[2]:3

Fields to the north and east of the mound have also been known to produce small artifacts, such as stone chips and flakes. Unlike the mound, the surrounding fields have never been excavated professionally;[2]:2 however, as all other known mounds of the Clemson Island culture are associated with villages, the presence of the artifacts in the fields indicates that a village site was once located in the fields to the north of the mound.[2]:3

Significance[edit]
Comparison with similar sites in New York indicates that the Book Site is among the earliest Late Woodland sites in central Pennsylvania. Moreover, the large amount of Clemson Island pottery makes it a type site for this kind of pottery; consequently, the Book Site is a prime archaeological site.[2]:6 In 1986, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its archaeological value.[1]

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE
The editor and his printer made every effort to reproduce Washington's journal precisely and without any corrections, noting in the Preface "with that literal exactness as to text which can only be assured by the careful efforts of an experienced copyist and expert proof reader having access to and comparing in every possible case the copies with the originals."
This etext preserves that intent, and no corrections of spelling or punctuation have been made to the journal text (Washington's words as found in the printed book). A few corrections have been made to the editor's Footnotes and to the Index; more detail of that can be found at the end of the book.
Footnotes have been left in-line whenever possible, following the format of the original text. Some that were placed mid-paragraph have been moved to the end of the paragraph.
One unusual symbol is denoted by ɭ (Unicode Hex026d) on page 107, in the string '6400 ɭ 400'. Author's meaning is not clear.

PREFACE.

Washington's Journal here given to the public, if we except his version of the "Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation," is the earliest literary effort of this, the most admirable character in all history. The editor has long been engaged in collecting accurate copies of all the obtainable writings of this great man. Wherever it has been found practicable to examine and critically compare even his generally accepted writings with the originals, it has been, or will be done to secure a copy of exact and verified conformity, in every particular, with the text as it left the hand of the writer.
It is a well-known fact that editors have taken great liberties with Washington's writings, not for the purpose of falsifying history, or aspersing his character, but from a variety of reasons, often to suppress caustic expressions, or to substitute a more euphonious word to give to his sentences a fine, rhetorical finish. Such editorial dressing, even where the motive is well intended, is vicious in principle and liable to abuse; and, in the case of Washington's writings, is neither justifiable nor desirable. The time has come when the people want to know intimately and without glamour or false coloring, the father of his country as he actually lived and labored,[6] and to possess his writings, just as he left them, on every subject which engaged his attention. It is the purpose of the editor to prepare a complete collection of all the writings of George Washington, from his youth to the close of his eventful life, with that literal exactness as to text which can only be assured by the careful efforts of an experienced copyist and expert proof reader having access to and comparing in every possible case the copies with the originals. This initial Diary of Washington opens with his sixteenth year, and plainly shows the energy and the maturity of his judgment, and his capability to discharge even then important trusts with efficiency.
Forthcoming volumes will give, in chronological order, his co-operation in the march of events on this continent, and his life and opinions as seen through the writings he left. This volume must be viewed as the work of a youth, making a few, brief and hurried memoranda while in the depths of the forest and intended for no eye but his own. The time is not far distant when an edition of Washington's more important papers will be called for in facsimile by some one of the photogravure processes now available for such purposes, because of the unquestionable fidelity to the original it secures and which is approximately arrived at in this publication.
This is the first systematic attempt to produce the writings of Washington with literal exactness as to abbreviations, the use of capitals, punctuation, spelling, etc. It is possible that the plan pursued may[7] not, at first, meet with an unqualified commendation from the public. But if the editor does not much mistake the desire of students, the admirers of Washington and the demand of historians, this method, if faithfully executed, must produce the preferred edition of his writings.
A few miscellaneous pieces in Washington's youthful handwriting are preserved in this Journal, and are here printed with the same effort for literal accuracy which has been bestowed upon the Journal itself, and upon his field notes of land surveys.

INTRODUCTION.

This journal of George Washington, now for the first time printed entire and with literal exactness, was begun, as shown by the date in the opening lines, when he was but one month over sixteen years of age. It is his own daily record of observations during his first remunerated employment. His proficiency as a surveyor, and his fortitude in encountering the hardships of the forest in this expedition were, considering his age, truly remarkable. With him the beginning determined the end. Biographers have made us acquainted with the character of his worthy parents, and with the sturdy stock from which they were descended. It does seem as though Providence called our Washington into being, and educated him in the western world just at the time when a great leader was wanted to direct a revolution, and to found on this continent a new and a free, English-speaking nation. Every factor, whether of lineage or culture, in the admirably balanced character of Washington, as well as every aspiration of his heart, from his cradle to his grave, is of high interest to the world. Although deprived of a father's care at the age of[10] eleven years, he was, however, especially blessed in having such a mother as the noble Mary Washington, who conscientiously discharged her sacred duty as his guardian, counselor and friend. Hence filial reverence grew with his growth and strengthened with his maturing years into fixed principles, making him throughout all his eventful life loyal to every virtue and heroic in every trust.
When George Washington set out on the enterprise herein narrated, he was just out of school, where he had received the best education the neighborhood could supply, supplemented with good private instruction. We may well believe that his mother and his brothers then supposed that George had attained an age and proficiency when he should either go to college to acquire a higher education, or embark speedily in some respectable calling; and we may further conclude that this precocious youth was eager to take part in the affairs of life, and deferentially announced his preference for the latter course. Possibly he was influenced in this selection by his great admiration for his half-brother, Major Lawrence Washington, who was actively and prosperously engaged in various business enterprises, who made much of George, and had him visit Mount Vernon whenever it was practicable.
George Washington's aptitude for mathematics early attracted the attention of his teachers, and his beautifully kept copy-books, which are still preserved, attest his unusual ability in mathematical demonstra[11]tion and diagrams. Mr. Williams, the principal of the Academy in Westmoreland county, Va., where young Washington was, to give a practical value to this mathematical talent, had added surveying and navigation to his other studies; and these were soon mastered by this bright pupil. Land surveying was then a profitable and genteel pursuit in the colonies, and it comported well with Washington's tastes and inclinations. While visiting his brother at Mount Vernon, he had repeatedly amused himself and entertained guests of the house by surveying, in their presence, the garden, or a field, and rapidly drawing plats of them as an exercise. A few maps of such early surveys have been preserved. One of them, of Lawrence Washington's turnip field, bearing date 27 Feb., 1747-8, is reproduced in fac-simile in this publication. The others are without date, but are of about the same period; although one, namely that of "Hell Hole," a part of the Mount Vernon estate, and frequently mentioned in Washington's later diaries, may have been an earlier production. A fac-simile of it may also be found in this work.
Washington's efficiency and enthusiasm as a surveyor were observed and admired not only by his friend and companion, George William Fairfax, but also by the Hon. Wm. Fairfax and by Lord Fairfax, who were constantly employing surveyors to lay off lands for sale in the latter's large domain known as "The Northern Neck" of Virginia. During the early spring of 1748 the demands for surveys were[12] more than usually pressing by actual settlers in the Shenandoah valley. Lord Fairfax engaged the youth, George Washington, to proceed with George William Fairfax, his agent, as recorded in this journal, to execute certain commissions and meet a pressing demand. His surveys and reports gave entire satisfaction and led to his steady employment by his titled patron, principally as a director of his lordship's land office and of the surveys, preparatory to sale. Washington filled this position for about three years, when he was called upon to accompany his brother Lawrence, who, from failing health, was constrained, in the fall of 1751, to visit the West Indies in the hope of finding relief.
The journal kept by George Washington during his visit to Barbadoes in company with his brother, will be given in a separate work soon to be issued in its chronological order by the editor. The journal here presented to the public is, in the main, confined to Washington's daily entries, memoranda and field notes of surveys of land situated between the Blue Ridge and the Alleghany mountains.
Unfortunately the records of his surveys are not consecutive, and it is quite evident that they represent but a part, and probably but a small part, of the land surveyed by Washington for Lord Fairfax and others. The notes of surveys here published are all that can be found or that are now known to exist. It is to be hoped, however, that if other books of his field notes of surveys have escaped destruction, they may yet be[13] discovered. This hope is encouraged from the fact that the laws of the colony required surveyors, upon retiring from their official stations as county surveyors, to deposit their field books of notes of surveys with the records of the county. How far this law was complied with, the editor is unable to say. It is a mistake, however, to infer that Washington was constantly employed in actually running lines and taking field notes. He was largely charged with the supervision of Lord Fairfax's land office, and the records thereto belonging, and was his principal adviser in his land surveys, directing the men employed in the field work.
This journal, with its memoranda and surveys, makes a valuable addition to our knowledge of the life and employments of Washington in his youth. Here are also preserved the names of nearly three hundred of the early settlers and first land owners in the great valley of Virginia, for whom Washington made surveys, or who assisted him in this business.
It was a cherished hope of the editor that he might be able to give, in notes, brief sketches of the pioneers in the valley here named, through the assistance of their descendants, who, in many instances, reside upon lands surveyed by Washington for their ancestors. In this, however, he has been disappointed.
The journal, memoranda and surveys found in these books have all been copied with literal exactness and are here printed just as they were recorded by the hand of their author. This literalness is ad[14]hered to in the interest of truth and for the benefit of earnest students of history unable to consult personally the originals. Washington requires no apology for any apparent want of style or other marks of hasty composition in this journal. It was written in the nature of a memorandum intended for himself alone. His thoughts, even in these youthful productions, flow easily and in an orderly and consecutive manner. His sentences are never involved or obscure, and his observations are always apt and instructive; and, although a youth in years when this journal was written, he was dealing ably with important interests, and deporting himself in a manly manner, and associating on terms of intimacy with the foremost men of the day. He seems to have had no idle boy life, but was a man with manly instincts and ambitions from his youth. Time and accidents are slowly, but effectually, destroying the precious original manuscripts, so that a literal and authentic copy is a great desideratum. No liberty whatever is taken by the editor with the text as recorded by Washington. The notes which are added, it is hoped, may prove of interest.

JOURNAL.

A Journal of my Journey over the Mountains began Fryday the 11th of March 1747-8.[1]
Fryday March 11th 1747-8. Began my Journey[2] in Company with George Fairfax, Esqr.;[3] we travell'd this day 40 Miles to Mr George Neavels[4] in Prince William County.[5]
[1] Double dating of the year, as is done here, was an old custom observed between January 1st and the 25th of March. For all other portions of the year a single date was used. Although January 1st had been generally accepted as the beginning of the historical year in Christian countries, yet March 25th was held by some as the beginning of the civil or legal year. The Gregorian chronology or new style had not, at the time this journal was written, been adopted by England, and, indeed, was not until September 2nd, 1752.
[2] The party on this expedition set out from "Belvoir," the home and plantation of the Hon. William Fairfax, described by General Washington as "within full view of Mount Vernon, separated by water only, is one of the most beautiful seats on the river." (Letter to John Sinclair, 11 December, 1796.) It was founded by William Fairfax, cousin and agent to Lord Thomas Fairfax, and was his residence until his death in 1757. The estate then passed to his eldest son, George William Fairfax, also one of Lord Fairfax's agents, and was his residence until July, 1773, when, accompanied by his wife, he went to England to attend to some property he had inherited there. Washington, his friend and neighbor, consented to act as his agent during his absence, which, at the time, neither anticipated would be of long continuance.
[16]
"Law's delay" and business interests making it important for Mr. Fairfax to remain in England, he directed Washington to dispose of his stock, farm fixtures and household effects at public sale. After due advertisement, this was done August 15, 1774. A second sale at "Belvoir" took place December 5, 1774.
The following bill of household effects bought at this first sale at Belvoir by George Washington has been preserved among his private papers and was in the possession of one of his inheritors, Lawrence Washington, in January 1891. The bill in the auctioneer's handwriting was folded and endorsed in Washington's known hand:—"Articles bought by Go Washington at Colo Fairfax's Sale 15 August 1774."

The following admirable description of the estate is taken from an advertisement in the Pennsylvania Gazette of Philadelphia, October 19, 1774:
"To be rented from year to year, or for a term of years,—Belvoir, the beautiful seat of the Honorable Geo. W. Fairfax, Esq., upon the Potomac river, in Fairfax county, about 14 miles below Alexandria.
"The mansion is of brick, two stories high, with four convenient rooms, and a large passage on the lower floor; five rooms and a large passage on the second; servants' hall and cellar below; convenient to it are offices, stables and coach-house; adjacent is a large and well furnished garden stored with a great variety of fruits, all in good order.
"Appertaining to the tract on which these houses stand and which contains near 2,000 acres (surrounded in a manner by navigable water), are several valuable fisheries and a good deal of clear land in different parts which may be let all together or separately as shall be found most convenient.
[18]
"The terms may be known of Colonel Washington who lives near the premises, or of me in Berkeley county.
"Francis Willis, Junior."
The estate was leased to the Rev. Andrew Morton for a term of seven years. Unfortunately the mansion was destroyed by fire only a few years later. The owner's long absence, and the fact that there was no house to invite a careful tenant, together with the excitement and derangement of business incident to the war for independence, caused the estate rapidly to depreciate in value. Early in 1775 Washington relinquished the agency of George W. Fairfax's business in America, as his time was fully taken up in directing the momentous affairs of the Revolution.
[3] George William Fairfax, eldest son of the Hon. William Fairfax, of "Belvoir," Va., was born in Nassau, New Providence, West Indies, in 1724. His father having been appointed to the custom house in Salem, Massachusetts, he was taken to that town and resided there until 1734, about which time his father accepted the agency of Lord Fairfax's lands in Virginia, and removed to that province. For a time he resided in Westmoreland county, Va., but after a couple of years he settled upon and developed the "Belvoir" estate on the Potomac river. George William Fairfax was educated in England, and coming to his majority settled at "Belvoir," and married Sarah, daughter of Col. Wilson Cary, of Hampton, Va., who some writers, on rather apocryphal testimony, endeavor to show was an object of Washington's ardent devotion when a mere youth. The same compliment has also been claimed for her sister Mary, who married Edward Ambler, and for other belles of that period in Virginia, as well as in some of the other colonies. George W. Fairfax, after his marriage, resided part of the time at "Belvoir," and part at "Greenway Court," as agent of Lord Fairfax, in the vicinity of which he owned and cultivated lands. On his father's death in 1757 he inherited "Belvoir," where he continued to reside until the summer of 1773, when, accompanied by his wife, he went to England to look after some property he had inherited there. The proprietors of "Belvoir" and "Mount Vernon" and their families were always on the most friendly terms, as the letters extant of each attest, and Washington's diaries fully confirm. Mr. Fairfax[19] favored the early protests by the colonies and petitions to the king in the interests of the colonies, but opposed measures looking to forcible resistance. Washington consented to act as his agent while he was absent, presuming his stay in England would be of short duration. But a complication of matters detained him abroad so that he instructed his agent to sell off his stock at "Belvoir" and lease the property. A sale was accordingly held on the estate in August, 1774, which continued two days. A second and further sale was held in December the same year. The property was leased in 1774 for seven years, but shortly after this the mansion house was burned down and never rebuilt. During the Revolutionary war some of Mr. Fairfax's property in Fairfax county was escheated to the state. His loss of income from America led him to limit his expense, he therefore removed from Yorkshire to Bath and lived in a modest way, dividing generously, from his limited means, with the American prisoners of war held in England. He had no children. A friendly correspondence was kept up between him and Washington to the close of his life. He was urged to return to America, but his mansion at "Belvoir" having been destroyed by fire he kept putting it off and never returned. He left "Belvoir" and some other landed property to Ferdinand, son of his half-brother, Rev. Bryan Fairfax, and died at Bath in England, April 3, 1787, and was buried in Wirthlington church. His will appointed George Washington as one of his executors. His wife survived him until 1812. Her remains were placed by the side of her husband's.
[4] George Neville, Esq., was among the earliest planters to settle in the western part of Prince William county, Va. As early as, or before 1730, he selected a large body of desirable land lying on the main road by way of Ashby's Gap from Fredericksburg to Winchester. Here his residence was beautifully situated on high, healthy and productive land near the head springs of Bull Run, a tributary of the Occoquan river, and 34 miles from Fredericksburg, the head of tide water on the Rappahannock river. Squire Neville, the proprietor of this fine estate, as he was usually called, was a man of steady and industrious habits, possessed a fine constitution, gentle in his manners, and cultured in his tastes, enterprising and thrifty, with a genius for overcoming such difficulties as always beset[20] the path of the pioneer in a new country. As the lands to the west of him, and particularly those in the Shenandoah valley beyond the Blue Ridge, began to attract settlers the travel on the road past his house became considerable, and as a matter of accommodation to the public he opened an ordinary and kept a store for general merchandizing. Neville's Ordinary was a land mark, and is to be found on Fry and Jefferson's Map of Virginia, as well as on Governor Pownall's and other early maps of Virginia. In 1750 Washington surveyed for Mr. Neville 400 acres of land. By marriage George Neville was related to the Fairfax family of Virginia. His wife, Ann Burroughs, was a cousin to Lord Thomas Fairfax of "Greenway Court," the proprietor of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Squire Neville and his wife were blessed with a numerous family of healthy sons and daughters, who inherited the sturdy virtues of their parents, and who founded families for themselves, and whose descendants are to be found throughout the southern and western states. Joseph Neville, son of George, was a prosperous planter in the western part of Prince William county, Va., in 1760. (See Washington's Diary.) He served as a colonel in the Revolution, was one of the commissioners for running the boundary line between Pennsylvania and Virginia, and was a member of Congress 1793-5; died in Hardy county, Va., 1819. John Neville, another son, was colonel of the 4th Virginia regiment in the Revolution, and brigadier-general in the Pennsylvania militia at the close of the war. He was born in Virginia 26 July, 1731. From his youth he had a fondness for military affairs and served in the Braddock expedition, and also in the Dunmore Indian war. He and his brothers were early and life-long friends of General Washington, the acquaintance beginning when they were youths. At an early date John Neville took up considerable tracts of land in Frederick and Augusta counties, Va. He resided for some years in the Shenandoah valley, being at one time sheriff of Frederick county. He also acquired large tracts of land on Chartier's creek in Pennsylvania, and had built himself a house preparatory to taking up his residence there, when the Revolutionary war began, in which he took an active and honorable part. This event postponed, for some years, his removal with his family to Pennsylvania. On the 24th August, 1754, he was united in marriage to Winifred Oldham, by whom he had two[21] children, a son and a daughter, Presley and Amelia. Presley Neville married Nancy, daughter of General Daniel Morgan, and they became the progenitors of the large and influential family of Nevilles of Pittsburg, Pa. Colonel Presley Neville, as he was called, served in the Revolution for three years on the staff of General Lafayette. Amelia Neville married Major Isaac Craig of the Revolution, and they became the founders of the well known and esteemed family of Craigs of Pittsburg.—Eagle's Pennsylvania Genealogies.
[5] Prince William county, Va., formed in 1730 from Stafford and King George counties, embraced territory extending from the Potomac river on the east to the summit of the Blue Ridge on the west; it was divided from Loudoun county by the Occoquan and Bull Run streams. Prior to 1822 the county seat was at Dumfries, but at that date it was removed to Brentville.
Saturday March 12th this Morning Mr James Genn ye surveyor[6] came to us, we travel'd over ye Blue Ridge[7] to Capt Ashbys[8] on Shannondoah River,[9] Nothing remarkable happen'd.
[6] James Genn, a licensed surveyor in Virginia, much employed by Lord Fairfax, and frequently mentioned by Washington, and whose name often appears signed to surveys in which the latter was engaged, as the surveyor or director, is doubtless the person to whom reference is here made.
[7] Blue Ridge—the most easterly of the mountain ranges of the United States. The name properly restricted however, applies especially to that portion of the Appalachian range south of the Potomac river. In some parts of Pennsylvania it is known as Kittatinny and at some places in Maryland as South Mountain. It attains its greatest altitude in Virginia at the Peaks of Otter, which are about 4,000 feet above sea level.
[8] Capt. Ashby resided on the Shenandoah river above Burwell's island and the great bend of that stream, at which place he maintained a ferry and kept a house of entertainment. It was on the natural line by which travel came from the tide-water region of Virginia, through a gap in the Blue Ridge and across the Shenandoah valley to the country beyond. Being a[22] man of great courage and usefulness, he was deservedly popular among the early settlers, and his name was given not only to his ordinary but also to the gap and to the ferry. There was, too, a Fort Ashby on Patterson creek, near the town of Frankfort. There are numerous families bearing the name of Ashby throughout the southern and western states, who are probably descendants of this famous pioneer. General Turner W. Ashby, an officer of distinction in the Confederate army, is presumably of this family. The name still attaches to the gap in the mountains, but it has been superseded at the old ferry.
[9] Shenandoah river—this is the largest tributary of the Potomac. The name is of Indian origin, and in the aboriginal language is said to signify "the daughter of the stars." Kercheval, in his History of the Valley of Virginia, says the name was first written Gerando, then Sherandoch, and now we have Shenandoah. The river has its head in Augusta county near the divide where the head-waters of the James river take their rise. The Shenandoah flows for about 170 miles through a broad valley over a limestone bed between the North mountain on the one side and the Blue Ridge on the other, to the Potomac river at Harper's Ferry. This valley was the theater of many important military operations during the late war. The name of Sherando is perpetuated in the name of a post-office in Augusta county on the head-waters of the Shenandoah.

[10] Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord and Baron of Cameron, born in England in 1691, died at his residence "Greenway Court," Frederick county, Virginia, on the 12th of December, 1781. His remains were interred within the Episcopal church of Winchester, Va. His residence and other improvements were familiarly called "Quarters" and "Hunting Lodge," chiefly because he had in contemplation the erection of a commodious mansion. Lord Fairfax was the son of Thomas, 5th Lord Fairfax[23] and his wife Catherine, daughter of Lord Culpeper, once governor of Virginia. He was educated at Oxford and afterward held a commission in the British army. He was a fine scholar, and is said to have been a contributor to The Spectator. He succeeded to his father's title and to his mother's extensive landed estate known as the "Northern Neck of Virginia," lying between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers and estimated at 5,700,000 acres. For some years after coming into possession of this property it was left in the hands of agents. He finally employed his cousin, the Hon. William Fairfax, son of Henry and Anne (Harrison) Fairfax, as his agent in the management of his lands. About 1739 Lord Fairfax first visited his estate in America. For a year he devoted himself to becoming thoroughly acquainted with his possessions and then returned to England. Four years later, in 1745, he returned to this country and for a time made his home at "Belvoir," the seat of his relative and agent.
A branch office for the sale of lands in the valley of Virginia, had been opened in Frederick county in 1742. The main office and records, however, were not removed from "Belvoir" until 1761.
Lord Fairfax built for himself a stone lodge with quarters for his servants, reserving around it a manor of 10,000 acres which he called "Greenway Court." The lodge was about twelve miles south-east of Winchester, at which place he purposed to build a castle, but this was never erected. His lodge was, however, sufficiently spacious for him to live in comfortably, and exercise a generous hospitality. He possessed a good library and was frequently visited by men of note whom he entertained in an elegant manner. He was fond of the chase and took an active interest in the management of his estate, as well as in the affairs of the colony, as his letters fully prove. He identified himself with the people as far as was practicable, and was deservedly popular. He served as lieutenant of Frederick county in the militia organizations; presided as one of the judges in the county courts at Winchester, and was an overseer of the public roads.
He met at "Belvoir," George Washington, when a youth, and, pleased with his energy and talents, employed him to survey lands beyond the Blue Ridge, which were to be sold. This was Washington's first remunerated employment. The[24] acquaintance thus begun, ripened into a friendship that was cherished by both through life.
Although a frank loyalist, his age and prudence in refraining from all participation in the Revolutionary struggle, protected him from being interfered with either by the government or by his neighbors. He died at the age of ninety-three, before peace was restored. His barony and its prerogatives, according to English law, descended, in the absence of a son, to his eldest brother, Robert, who thus became 7th Lord Fairfax. The latter died in Leeds Castle, England, 1791, without a son. The baronial title then fell to the Rev. Bryan Fairfax, of "Towlston Hall," Fairfax county, Va., who died 7 August, 1802. The great landed estates with their entails were, however, in effect confiscated by the success of the Revolution. The Legislature of Virginia in 1785 passed an act in relation to the "Northern Neck" to the following effect. "And be it further enacted, that the land holders within the said district of the Northern Neck shall be for ever hereafter exhonorated and discharged from composition and quit rents, any laws, customs or usage, to the contrary notwithstanding." Revised Code of the Laws of Virginia, vol. 1, p. 351, 2, 3. "Greenway Court" was devised by his lordship to his nephew, Rev. Denny Martin, residing in England, on condition of his obtaining the consent of Parliament to change his name to Fairfax. This was done, and he was afterward known as "Denny, Lord Fairfax." Like his uncle, he left no children and therefore bequeathed the estate to two maiden sisters in England. The legatees of the Fairfax estate sold their interest to Chief Justice John Marshall, Raleigh Colston, Esq. and General Henry Lee. They divided it up and sold it out in small farms, and quieted the titles. It is believed that no part of this vast body of Fairfax land is now held by any member of the family.—Sparks, Drake and others.

The year before he had bought from John and Isaac Van Meter a warrant for nearly 40,000 acres of land in the Shenandoah valley which they had obtained from Governor Gooch of Virginia in 1730. Capt. Hite brought with him from Pennsylvania sixteen families, all of whom settled in the same vicinity on fine arable ground. They were all judges of good lands and devoted to agriculture. The descendants of Hite are quite numerous throughout the southern and south-western states, and many farms in the valley are still held under titles derived from him. Kercheval says, Joist Hite built a stone house on the Opequon shortly after his coming to the valley. It is still standing and has a very ancient appearance though there are no discoverable marks to fix the date. On the wall plate of a frame barn, however, built by Hite, the figures "1747" are plainly marked and can still be read.
[12] "Frederick Town," properly Winchester, is the capital of Frederick county, Va. The latter was formed out of Orange county by Act of Assembly of Virginia in 1738, at the same time that Augusta county was formed. The choice of this site for the capital of the county was determined by the simple fact that a few hardy, adventurous Indian traders, as early as 1732 or even before that date, had built themselves cabins at this point known as the "Big Shawane Springs." These settlers gradually attracted others until a village was developed. This spring or one near it, an example of the great springs which are to be found in most limestone regions, furnishes the town of Winchester, to the present time, with an abundant supply of pure potable water. The site of the town was, all things considered, well chosen, in a fertile region and on the line of travel, whether across the valley to the Alleghany mountains and the waters of the Ohio river beyond, or along the great valley of the Shenandoah. James Wood was the projector of the town of Winchester, which was incorporated in 1752 by the Assembly of Virginia. However, twenty-six lots had been laid out[26] and sold by James Wood prior to this. Lord Fairfax shortly after this date made an addition to the town, and donated the ground for an Episcopal church. Frederick county early took measures to give protection to its settlers by building forts, making roads and establishing ferries. Its productive soil at the same time bountifully rewarded the husbandman for his labor. As the Frederick county courts were held at Winchester, the people adopted the southern habit of calling the place where the courts met by the name of the county, thus it was frequently spoken of as Frederick Town and is so designated in several of the early maps. Fort Loudoun was erected here by direction of the Assembly of Virginia in 1756, under the immediate supervision of Major Washington.
[13] Cate's marsh and Long marsh—these are names of small streams which flow from the foot hill of North mountain to the Shenandoah river and have along their course considerable meadow or marshy land. Long marsh is of sufficient importance to be named upon the maps of Virginia.
Tuesday 15th We set out early with Intent to Run round ye sd Land but being taken in a Rain &amp; it Increasing very fast obliged us to return, it clearing about one oClock &amp; our time being too Precious to Loose we a second time ventured out &amp; Worked hard till Night &amp; then return'd to Penningtons we got our Suppers &amp; was Lighted into a Room &amp; I not being so good a Woodsman as ye rest of my Company striped myself very orderly &amp; went in to ye Bed as they called it when to my Surprize I found it to be nothing but a Little Straw—Matted together without Sheets or any thing else but only one thread Bear blanket with double its Weight of Vermin such as Lice Fleas &amp;c[14] I was glad to get up (as soon as y [27]Light was carried from us) I put on my Cloths &amp; Lays as my Companions.

[14] For comments on fleas and other vermin see note 4. Washington's "Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour," p. 14, Washington's association with frontiersmen in their primitive cabins, which the position of a surveyor in the then almost unbroken forest necessitated, was to him a new and peculiar experience. His observations and reflections of the first few days are recorded with a naivete which is truly charming.

[15] This probably has reference to some pernicious weeds unfavorable to tillage and injurious to grazing animals, as St. John's wort. Farmers believe that this, and certain other noxious weeds which occasionally invade pasture fields, cause sore mouths and legs in horses and horned cattle and affect the milk of cows grazing where it grows.
Wednesday 16th We set out early &amp; finish'd about one oClock &amp; then Travell'd up to Frederick Town where our Baggage came to us we cleaned ourselves (to get Rid of y. Game[16] we had catched y. Night before) &amp; took a Review of y. Town &amp; thence return'd to our Lodgings where we had a good Dinner prepar'd for us Wine &amp; Rum Punch[17] in Plenty &amp; a good Feather Bed[18] with clean Sheets which was a very agreeable regale.
[16] This facetious term "game," referring to his misfortune the first night he lodged in the valley, has a touch of humor in it; and while it is true that Washington was not given to punning or indulging in witticisms, he was not deficient in imagination or unappreciative of the exercise of this talent on suitable occasions by others. He knew that good humor minimized most of the petty annoyances of life.
[17] The office and art of the surveyor were held in high esteem by the early settlers. It is, therefore, not surprising that the people for whom surveys were executed, made special efforts to give the surveying parties good dinners, even going so far as to[29] set before them "wine and rum punch." I may add here that there is neither tradition nor record that Washington was ever known to have been indiscreet from youth to age in the use of wine or strong drinks.
[18] Feather beds, a great luxury in former times, have nearly gone out of use among well-to-do people. By the wealthy, as well as by the laborers, they were once a greatly prized comfort and often devised by will as valuable inheritances. Hair, cotton and spring mattresses have displaced them from popular favor, but "clean sheets" belong to the category of comforts in even early times and must be a delight and joy forever.
Thursday 17th Rain'd till Ten oClock &amp; then clearing we reached as far as Major Campbells one of there Burgesses about 25 Miles from Town. nothing Remarkable this day nor Night but that we had a Tolerable good Bed lay on.
Fryday 18th We Travell'd up about 35 Miles to Thomas Barwicks on Potomack[19] where we found y. River so excessively high by Reason of y. Great Rains that had fallen up about y. Allegany Mountains as they told us which was then bringing down y. melted Snow &amp; that it would not be fordable for severall Days it was then above Six foot Higher than usual &amp; was rising we agreed to stay till Monday we this day call'd to see y.

[19] Cohongoruton—the Indian name by which the Potomac river was known to the Six Nations and other tribes of Indians. From its head-waters, to Point Lookout in the Chesapeake bay, this stream is the dividing line between Maryland and Virginia.
[20] The "Warm Springs," now known as "Bath" or "Berkeley Springs," were already famed, as Washington notes, in[30] 1747. They were deservedly popular for many years, but their remoteness and the difficulty of access to them, with the competition of other resorts more easily reached, prevented their receiving the attention which the value of their waters merited. A settlement sprang up about the springs at an early date, which finally became a prosperous village under the name of Bath, and was made the county seat when, in 1820, the county of Morgan was formed. Washington bought lots here, built a cottage and stables, and passed summers here with his family. His half-brother, Lawrence, spent nearly a year at the springs for the benefit of his health before going to England and later to Barbadoes. The property-right in the springs is in the state of Virginia, and is held for the benefit of the public.
Sonday 20th finding y. River not much abated we in y. Evening Swam our horses over &amp; carried them to Charles Polks in Maryland for Pasturage till y. next Morning.
Monday 21st We went over in a Canoe &amp; Travell'd up Maryland side all y. Day in a Continued Rain to Collo Cresaps[21] right against y. Mouth of y. South Branch[22] about 40 Miles from Polks I believe y. worst Road that ever was trod by Man or Beast.
[21] Cresap, Col. Thomas, the founder of the family in America, was born in Skipton, Yorkshire, England, and at the age of about fifteen came to America. Some five years later he resided at Havre-de-Grace, Md., where he married a Miss Johnson. Removing thence to Wright's Ferry, opposite the town of Columbia, where he obtained a Maryland title to a 500 acre tract of land called "Peach Bottom," and built himself a small stone house. The land, however, was on disputed territory, and claimants under the laws of Pennsylvania finally dispossessed him. His next move was to a locality in what is now Washington county, Md., where he located and settled upon a[31] tract of 1,400 acres on the Antietam creek, called "Long Meadows," and began trading with the Indians. After collecting a large lot of furs and skins he shipped them to England but was financially ruined through the capture of the vessel by the French. Unable to repay money he had borrowed from Mr. Dulany, of Maryland, he gave up to him his land, and moved farther west, built a cabin a few miles above the junction of the north and south branches of the Potomac, on the Maryland side, at a place which became known as "Old Town," but which he called Skipton, the name of his Yorkshire birthplace. This frontier spot became his permanent residence, where he eventually owned a large body of land on both sides of the Potomac. From his familiarity with the Indians and their habits and character, he was enabled to carry on with great advantage his trade with them and in time became the most important frontiersman of his day in Maryland. He took part with the Washingtons, Lee, Mason and others in the formation and early operations of "The Ohio Company," and in all matters of dealing with the Indians and prospecting for wild lands was the Company's chief dependence. With the aid of Namacolin, a noted Indian hunter, he laid out the first road over the Alleghany mountains to the head-waters of the Ohio. Gen. Braddock's expedition, and later the National road, followed nearly the same route. The attention attracted to the Ohio region through this Company's explorations, made it increasingly important to both England and France to possess and control the lands beyond the Ohio. This vigilance precipitated the war that drove out the French and secured to England and America the vast dominion known as the Northwest.
Col. Cresap's literary acquirements were small, but he had a vigorous mind, strong common sense, and was not deficient in practical self-education. He was one of the surveyors of Prince George's county which, at that period, embraced all the western part of Maryland. January 1, 1745, he surveyed for Gov. Thomas Bladen "Walnut Bottom" just below the mouth of Wills creek. He frequently represented his county in the Legislature and being noted for his clear understanding, sound judgment, firmness and courage, was esteemed one of the best legislators his county ever had. He was of medium stature, firmly set, of sound constitution, and lived to the uncommon[32] age of 105 or 106. He was twice married, the second time at the age of 80; by his first wife he had five children; three sons, Daniel, Thomas and Michael, and two daughters, Sarah and Elizabeth. Captain Michael Cresap was the person upon whom Thomas Jefferson fixed the stigma of the murder of the relatives of Logan. Jefferson having transmitted the pathetic speech of the Indian chief to the Abbe Raynal as an evidence of the original power of oratory of the aboriginal American, it is claimed more in a spirit of literary conceit than of conviction; however he failed during his life to correct the injustice done Cresap, although he was repeatedly furnished with the evidence exculpating Cresap and fixing the barbarous act on one Great-house. At his home, Col. Cresap dispensed, for his time and means, a generous hospitality to all callers, in a region where, as yet, no public houses were to be found. He kept a big kettle ready suspended to place a fire under, near a spring for the use of the Indians who often passed his place, and for this reason they designated him the "Big Spoon." Lord Baltimore employed him to run a survey of the western line of Maryland, and to ascertain which of the two branches of the Potomac was the largest. His autograph map of this survey is still preserved in the archives of the state of Maryland.
[22] The South Branch of the Potomac, of which the Indian name was Wappotomaka, rises in Pendleton county, West Virginia, among the spurs of the Alleghany and North mountains, and meets the North Branch about 20 miles below Cumberland, Md. The latter branch has been accepted as the dividing line between Maryland and Virginia, although now known to be neither as long nor as large as the South Branch. A line drawn due north from the extreme head-waters of the South Branch would run ten miles to the west of a parallel line from the head springs of the North Branch, thus proving the loss by Maryland of this strip of territory, as well as the region between the two branches, had the South Branch been taken instead of the North Branch as the main river referred to in the Royal Charter, and made the line separating the contiguous colonies. The valley through which the South Branch flows is broad and its lands very fertile, causing them to be much sought after for farms by the hardy pioneers in the early days before the Revolution. It was then familiarly known as the "upper tract" of Virginia.

Tuesday 22d Continued Rain and y. Freshes kept us at Cresaps.
Wednesday 23d Rain'd till about two oClock &amp; Clear'd when we were agreeably surpris'd at y. sight of thirty odd Indians coming from War with only one Scalp[23] We had some Liquor with us of which we gave them Part it elevating there Spirits put them in y. Humour of Dauncing of whom we had a War Daunce[24] there manner of Dauncing is as follows Viz They clear a Large Circle &amp; make a Great Fire in y. middle then seats themselves around it y. Speaker makes a grand Speech telling them in what Manner they are to Daunce after he has finish'd y. best Dauncer Jumps up as one awaked out of a Sleep &amp; Runs &amp; Jumps about y.

[23] Scalp—a term applied to the tissues covering the human head, and embracing all the hairy integuments and flattened muscles from the back of the skull to the brow above the eyes. Taking the scalp of an enemy, living or dead, has been held from remote times as a special sign of victory and token of triumph. The North American Indians, particularly during the early colonial wars, took the scalps of their enemies, preserving and exhibiting them with savage pride and occasionally wearing them as decorations and trophies. The assembly of Virginia, in 1755, established a reward of £10 for every scalp[34] of a male Indian above the age of twelve (Hening's Statutes, vol. VI, p. 551). In 1757 this sum was raised to £15, and £30 more for every scalp taken within the next two years (Hening, VII, p. 122). Maryland and Pennsylvania also offered rewards for Indian scalps.
[24] The war dance of the Indians probably had a significance to their minds not understood by civilized man, and was not to them the meaningless custom it seems to us. It has frequently been described and painted by eye-witnesses. In 1857 Virtue, Emmins &amp; Co. copyrighted a very effective engraving of a war dance in the forest, arranged from Washington's description of it in this journal.
Fryday 25th 1748 Nothing Remarkable on thursday but only being with y. Indians all day so shall slip it this day left Cresaps &amp; went up to y. mouth of Patersons Creek[25] &amp; there swam our Horses over got over ourselves in a Canoe &amp; traveld up y. following Part of y. Day to Abram Johnstones 15 Miles from ye Mouth where we camped.
[25] Paterson Creek rises in Hampshire county, West Virginia, and empties into the Potomac about twelve miles below Cumberland, Md. On the old maps of Evans, Hutchins and Lewis, the name is given as Pattison. There are large tracts of good, arable land along the valley and bottoms adjacent to this stream. They began to attract settlements a little before the time Fort Cumberland was built. Fort Ashby was also erected to protect settlers along this stream.
Saterday 26 Travelld up ye Creek to Solomon Hedges Esqr one of his Majestys Justices of ye Peace for ye County of Frederick where we camped when we came to Supper there was neither a Cloth upon ye Table nor a Knife to eat with but as good luck would have it we had Knives of own.[26]
[26] Knife and fork at table.—Polished nations have usages[35] which, at first view, appear natural or common to all mankind. This, however, is not the fact. That there was a period in the history of our race when the knife and fork were unknown to the furnishings of the table, cannot well be doubted; and there was even a time when the table itself was not deemed an essential. At the present day the idea of eating a meal at table without the accompaniment of a knife and fork would excite disgust; their absence, however, in a remote Virginia mountain cabin in 1747-8 as here recorded, simply shows that they had not been provided nor deemed essential to the life of a hunter, not an ignorance of their use, as the two-pronged, iron, table fork was in common use at that period throughout the settlements in all the American colonies. It is nevertheless true that the knife and fork now deemed so necessary at table, are a much more modern convenience than is generally supposed. The king of Hungary, Coevinus, toward the close of the fifteenth century, as related by Galeotus Martius, ate his meat with his fingers as did all the guests at table. In Italy, the fork was, to a limited extent, in use at this time among the nobility. In France, at the end of the sixteenth century, forks were comparatively new at court. The use of the table fork is referred to in "Washington's Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour," and in Hawkins' Youths' Companion, the source of these rules printed about 1650. The knife is perhaps one of the most ancient of instruments, it was made of different metals and in a great variety of forms. The table knife was, however, contemporary with the fork. According to Chamberlin it was first made in England, in 1563. The use of the fork at table spread to Europe from Venice, in Italy. In 1608 it was brought to England by Thomas Coryate who, while traveling, observed its use in Italy and continued it himself on his return to England. (See his work entitled "Crudities.") It is rather disappointing that neither the Greeks nor Romans have even a name for the table fork. The flesh fork, called creagra, with a long handle, for cooks to take meat out of a boiling pot, was known and used by the Hebrews and the Greeks. But had the table fork been used by the latter or by the Romans, some specimens would have been found among those extensive ruins which have been so carefully explored by modern investigators. It is known that some articles have been found, the use of which conjecture assigns to the table,[36] but they are not forks and the surmise is not generally credited. The Chinese, who claim to have led the rest of the world in most of the economic inventions, seem to have overlooked the table fork and do not even now use it in cutting or conveying food to the mouth but employ in its stead the "chop sticks" which, it must be said in their praise, they use with skill and dexterity. It should be stated that large bronze forks were used by the Egyptians in presenting offerings to the gods. It is unpleasant to represent the tables of our ancestors of a few centuries back as without forks, yet this certainly was the fact. The silver table fork, which also had its evolution from two to four prongs, was first manufactured in 1662 by Heylin.
The small knife, formerly worn by gentlemen at their girdles, was used by them, not only as a weapon of defense, but also as an article of convenience in cutting their meat. However, the ancient custom of serving food at table was to have a servant cut meats and other food into small morsels before distributing it to guests. The wealthy employed a person whose special duty it was to carve the meats into proper and convenient pieces and his was the only knife in the dining hall. When the fork was first introduced into England, its employment was ridiculed as an effeminate practice, as may be seen in the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, and others where the persons using it are referred to as "your fork-carving-traveler."
Sunday 27th Travell'd over to y. South Branch attended with y. Esqr to Henry Vanmetriss[27] in order to go about Intended Work of Lots[28]
[27] Henry Van Metre or Meter.—There was a numerous family of the Van Meters in Virginia and they were among the earliest settlers in the valley of the Shenandoah, on the South Branch and along the upper Potomac. Kercheval, in his History of the Valley of Virginia, says this family came from New York and New Jersey. It is evident that they were people of energy and thrift, judges of good land. At a period antedating the settlements in the valley, it is stated by this historian that a John Van Meter, a sort of wandering Indian trader, of New York, accompanied the Delaware Indians in a war party against the Catawbas; but the Catawbas anticipating the attack,[37] surprised and defeated the Delawares in a battle fought near where the present court-house of Pendleton stands. John Van Meter escaped and returned to New York, but he was so impressed with the beauty and fertility of the lands on the South Branch bottom in Hardy county, that he advised his sons to secure lands and locate there. Of these sons, Isaac became a man of note and frequently represented Hardy county in the House of Delegates of Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia Convention of 1788 which ratified the Federal Constitution. In 1730, it is a matter of history that John and Isaac Van Metre, brothers, obtained from Gov. Gooch, of Virginia, a warrant for 40,000 acres of land to be located west of the mountains. This warrant, or a part of it, they sold to Joist Hite. A number of tracts on the original warrant were surveyed in the vicinity of Shepherdstown. The name of Van Meter is still frequently met with throughout West Virginia and has its monument in a stream forming the north-western boundary line of Jefferson county and emptying into the Potomac, and named on the maps of Virginia Van Meter's Marsh. A controversy as to the validity of the Van Metre patent was raised in 1738 by Lord Fairfax and taken into the courts for adjudication. Lord Fairfax contending that his grants covered the whole of the western end of the northern neck, while the holders claimed that the governor, under authority from the crown, had disposing power. This conflict as to title was a source of much litigation, and was not finally settled until after the Revolution, when all the parties to the original suits were dead.
[28] Lots.—This term, as used by surveyors, indicates portions, tracts, divisions and subdivisions of land. Each survey, lot or division when plotted is usually indicated by some name or device, as a number, a letter, or a symbol. So that each can then be described and referred to in a deed or an advertisement, and its location and boundaries be accurately and systematically defined and described in a book of land records.
Monday 28th: Travell'd up y Branch about 30 Miles to Mr James Rutlidges[29] Horse Jockey &amp; about 70 Miles from ye Mouth
[29] James Rutledge.—Kercheval, in his History of the Valley[38] of Virginia, says that prominent among the earliest settlers on the South Branch, before the arrival of the Van Meters, were the Howards, Coburns, Walkers and Rutledges.
Tuesday 29th This Morning went out &amp; Survey'd five Hundred Acres of Land &amp; went down to one Michael Stumps on ye So Fork of ye Branch on our way Shot two Wild Turkies[30]
[30] The wild turkey.—This is the largest and finest of our game birds and, although native to North America, it bears a foreign name from the following circumstances. Specimens of the living bird, as well as its eggs, were sent by the early Jesuit missionaries to the old world on Spanish and Portuguese ships, entering Europe through Portugal. It was as yet unnamed, and was at first referred to by writers of that period merely as the "Jesuit bird." As it became known, the demand for the stranger was supplied chiefly from Turkey where, for some reason, it thrived exceedingly well, and in time it came to be familiarly spoken of as "the turkey." Gradually becoming tame, and proving to be quite prolific, it was recognized as a great addition to the luxuries of the table. Speedily becoming a favorite in every country to which it was taken, the great forests and game preserves throughout Europe were gradually stocked with it and it was also raised as a domestic fowl. To-day the American turkey, derived as stated, is found wild in all the great forests of the old world, while the domesticated bird is abundantly raised everywhere in Europe for the markets. In ancient times, we are told, the choicest game fowls brought to a feast were pheasants and peacocks. Emigrants to America brought over with them the domesticated bird to its native land, but under a borrowed name. Washington, in his journal, April 7, 1748, records the fact that one of his men that day had killed a wild turkey weighing 20 pounds. The domesticated bird, when permitted to attain the age of two or three years, and being well fed during the winter months, often reaches the weight of 30 pounds or more. As marking in a degree the devastation of the late war and the enforced abandonment of plantations in the section of Virginia adjacent to the city of Washington, it is a fact worthy of record, that in[39] 1876 the newspapers chronicled the news that the thickets and pine forests which were grown up since the armies left were tenanted by wild deer and turkeys; foxes, etc. And to this day, December 25, 1890, wild turkeys are brought to the Washington market killed in Fairfax county, Va., within ten miles of Washington city.—Gentlemen's Magazine.

[31] Manor line.—In colonial times there were a number of manors, or great landed estates, granted under the then existing laws of England, to persons of note and quality in Virginia and in some of the other provinces. Holders of such estates enjoyed special rights and privileges. Manors were formerly called baronies and entitled the rightful possessor to lordships, and such lord or baron was empowered to hold domestic courts for redressing misdemeanors, nuisances and settling disputes among tenants. Among the manors of limited privileges in Virginia may be enumerated the "manor of Greenway Court," with a domain of 10,000 acres. The great "manor of Leeds," which has figured so extensively in the courts of Virginia, contained 150,000 acres within the counties of Culpeper, Fauquier and Frederick. The "South Branch manor," in Hardy county, embraced 55,000 acres; "Paterson Creek manor," in Hampshire county, 9,000 acres; and "Goony Run manor," adjoining that of Leeds and lying chiefly in Shenandoah county, 13,000[40] acres. "Beverley's manor," for the most part in Augusta county, consisted of 118,411 acres, and "Fairfax manor," in Hampshire, of 10,000 acres. There were still other manors in different parts of the state. In New York under the Dutch government the baron or proprietor of the manor lands was called the patroon.
[32] Clay lick.—Names of places or streams with the word lick either prefixed or affixed to them, such as "Salt lick," "Blue lick," "Grass lick," "Licking creek," etc., were usually given in consequence of the presence of some saline matter in the springs, streams or soil which attracted the wild animals and caused them to lick for the salt. Hunters in new settlements often built what they called blinds near these licks in which to conceal themselves, and waited there for the game to come, as they were pretty sure to do, almost daily, and at times in considerable numbers, when they could be readily killed.
Wednesday 30th This Morning began our Intended Business of Laying of Lots we began at ye Boundary Line of ye Northern 10 Miles above Stumps &amp; run of two Lots &amp; returnd to Stumps
The Courses &amp; Distances of ye Several Lots lay'd of on ye So Fork of Wappacomo[33] Began March 30th. 1748
[33] "Wappacomo," also spelled "Wappatomaka," was the Indian name for the South Branch of the Potomac. This stream courses through a fine valley from its head-springs in Pendleton county, and has many considerable branches rising among the spurs of the Alleghany mountains on the one side and the North or Cacapehon (Capon) mountain on the other, the latter separating it from the valley of Virginia on the east. The great or most noted fork of the South Branch is at Morefield in Hardy county. Washington surveyed much of the land in that section. The young farmers seeking good lands had come in taken up considerable tracts and built improvements before surveys were made or any effort to prove rights from either Lord Fairfax or the governor of Virginia.

[34] Vacant—this term, as used by surveyors, indicates that the tract of land so designated is neither claimed by an actual occupant or occupied by virtue of any official record. Many of the settlers on the lands of Lord Fairfax selected their farms and made improvements without any legal survey, warrant or title, other than a "tomahawk blaze" for a boundary mark, trusting that the actual owner of the land would recognize the improvement and occupant's claim and deal justly by them. These "tomahawk claims" were respected by the actual settlers, had a market value among land speculators and were admitted, to a certain extent, as evidence of rights in the courts.

[35] Dutch.—As early as 1730 there was a considerable settlement in the Shenandoah valley, of German immigrants and their descendants, who had first settled in Pennsylvania and then removed to, and taken up lands in, the valley of Virginia. They selected, chiefly, the good limestone lands with their centers of population near the head-waters of the Opequon creek, in Shenandoah, and the south-western part of Frederick county. They were all Protestants in religion. The town of Woodstock was originally and exclusively settled by Germans. The bill for its incorporation was reported to the House of Burgesses of Va., by Col. George Washington in 1761. For many years the German language was exclusively spoken in their settlement, and German customs and religious observances were retained[46] with tenacity, their remoteness and seclusion securing to them almost perfect freedom from innovations. The Revolution found them patriotic supporters of the colony as against the pretensions of Great Britain. It was in the town of Woodstock, Shenandoah county, that Maj.-Gen. John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, minister of the Lutheran church, dressed in his uniform and with his sword buckled on, preached a farewell sermon in 1776, to a sympathizing and patriotic congregation, and the next day marched as colonel at the head of his German regiment, known subsequently as the 8th Virginia, to join the Continental army. Such names of places as Strasburg, Hamburg, Mecklenburg, the latter now known as Shepherdstown, etc., perpetuate the fact that many of the earliest settlers in that section were German.—See Kercheval, p. 158.

[36] The Red Bud or Judas tree.—A common tree that grows wild in the United States. In botany it is known as the "Cercis Canadensis," and often grows to the height of 30 feet or more. It flowers in April, clothing its limbs in a reddish-purple bloom for a week or ten days before its leaves appear, and from this circumstance it is popularly called red bud.
[37] Blazed trees.—These are surveyors' marks made on trees to proclaim and identify certain routes or lines. The "blaze" is made by removing with an axe a strip of the outer bark of a tree or sapling, for about a foot in length and well into the inner bark. In the future growth of the tree a lighter color marks the cicatrix which rarely ever wholly disappears. Surveyors, to distinguish corner trees in a survey, not only blaze the sides of the tree in the direction their lines run but cut three small notches through the bark which will remain distinct during the life of the tree.
[38] Widow Wolf.—There was a Fort Wolf on Stony creek a few miles south-west of Woodstock, erected by the Germans at an early period in the settlement of the valley; there is also a marsh or creek named Wolf's marsh, which empties into the Shenandoah about twelve miles above Ashby's Ferry. Possibly these were so called from the name of this widow's husband.

[39] Old Fields and Wild Meadow.—There were many small, timberless tracts of land on the mountains and in the great valleys of Virginia and Pennsylvania, in regions which were generally, prior to the occupation and the clearing up of the country by the white man, densely covered with trees. Large tracts of such timberless land existed in the region now embraced within the counties of Berkeley, Jefferson and Frederick. Strange as it may appear some of this kind of land within the history of the settlement of the valley became covered with young forest timber. In some respects these openings resembled the treeless prairies of the west. No satisfactory explanation of this frequently observed condition has ever been given. Many of these meadows were the favorite pasturing grounds of the large game and were, therefore, of special interest to the hunter. Clearfield county, Pa., it is believed, got its name from the fact that there were within its territory extensive natural clear fields and meadows.
Fryday 8th we breakfasted at Casseys &amp; Rode down to Vanmetris's to get all our Company together which when we had accomplished we Rode down below ye Trough in order to Lay of Lots there we laid of one this day The Trough is couple of Ledges of Mountain Impassable running side &amp; side together for above 7 or 8 Miles &amp; ye River down between them you must Ride Round ye back of ye Mountain for to get below them we Camped this Night in ye Woods near a Wild Meadow where was a Large Stack of Hay after we had Pitched our Tent &amp; made a very[51] Large Fire we pull'd out our Knapsack in order to Recruit ourselves every was his own Cook our Spits was Forked Sticks our Plates was a Large Chip as for Dishes we had none

[40] From the expression, "set the surveyor to work," as well as the language used in the record on the 12th of March, that "Mr. James Genn the surveyor came to us and traveled over the Blue Ridge, etc.," with other expressions at a later date of similar import in the journal and in other documents, it is rendered almost certain that George Washington was, from the first, employed by Lord Fairfax, not as a surveyor, merely, but rather in the capacity of a skilled director of other surveyors, and as the confidential adviser in the division and sale of his lordship's lands.
Sunday 10th We took our farewell of ye Branch &amp; travell'd over Hills and Mountains to 1 Coddys on Great Cacapehon about 40 Miles

[41] Williams' Gap, in the Blue Ridge, is on a line nearly due east from Winchester. It derived its name from a Mr. Williams, who kept a ferry over the Shenandoah river on one of the roads from Winchester into Loudoun and Fairfax counties. This name still attaches to the gap and appears on the early maps of Virginia. It is a notable fact that all or most of the important gaps through mountain passes in the United States were well worn buffalo paths and Indian trails when first visited by white men.
[42] Ashby's Bent is supposed to have reference to the great bend and extensive bottom lands of the Shenandoah, just above which was located Captain Ashby's ferry across that river. Washington uses this term in 1770 to describe a large tract of bottom land on the Ohio which he acquired.
[43] Fairfax county, in which Mount Vernon is located, was created out of Prince William county by the Assembly of Virginia in 1742.
Wednesday ye 13th of April 1748
Mr Fairfax got safe home and I myself safe to my Brothers[44] which concludes my Journal[45]
 
[44] Major Lawrence Washington, proprietor of Mount Vernon, was the second child and oldest surviving son of Augustine and his first wife Jane (Butler) Washington, born at Pope's Creek, Westmoreland county, Va., in 1718, and died at his residence, Mount Vernon, 26th July, 1752. He was the half-brother of the illustrious George Washington and great-grandson of the emigrant, Col. John Washington, who came to Virginia [53]about 1657. It is a matter of tradition that Lawrence was at about the age of 15 sent to England to be educated, and leaving college he received a captain's commission to serve in a regiment raised in Virginia to take part in the expedition against Carthegenia, 1740-42, under the command of Admiral Vernon.
The expedition failed of its purpose, and Major Lawrence Washington returned to Virginia in the fall of 1742. He shortly after became engaged to Anne Fairfax, which induced him to resign from the army. His father died April 12, 1743, leaving a considerable estate and named him, his oldest son, one of his executors. He inherited from his father "the Hunting creek" plantation, consisting of 2,500 acres, on the Potomac but a few miles from and in sight of "Belvoir." On the 19th of July Lawrence Washington was united in marriage to Anne, eldest daughter of the Hon. William Fairfax of "Belvoir." He made many improvements on his plantation and gave it the name of "Mount Vernon," in compliment to his old commander, Admiral Vernon. Lawrence Washington had received a good education, had mixed with prominent personages, had seen much of the world, and was a man of good habits and business qualifications.
His father at the time of his death, was largely engaged in business which Lawrence was obliged to look after and close up. This gradually led him into various business enterprises; such as the manufacturing of iron, buying and selling land, etc. He and his brother Augustin were among the organizers of "The Ohio Company," to explore the western country, encourage settlements, and conduct a trade with the Indians. He was elected to the House of Burgesses of Virginia from Fairfax county in 1748. It was largely through his influence that a charter was granted to the towns of Alexandria and Colchester, both in Fairfax county. He together with Lord Fairfax, George Mason, Hon. William Fairfax, William Ramsay, John Carlyle and others was named as trustee to lay out and govern the town. He was a popular legislator, but declined to serve longer in the Assembly, as it interfered with his present business. He was greatly attached to his brother George, and made it a point to have him with him at Mount Vernon whenever it was practicable without interrupting his studies. Lawrence was always of a delicate constitution, but by his prudent habits and systematic[54] attention to business he accomplished a great deal and enhanced the value of his possessions. He was tall in stature and a man of fine personal appearance, as is shown by an oil painting of him which still hangs upon the wall of the Virginia room in Mount Vernon mansion. He was rapidly becoming one of the leading business men of Virginia, when his health broke down. As a last resort his physicians recommended that he should spend a winter in the West Indies. In the fall of 1751, he resigned his commission as one of the adjutant-generals of Virginia, and taking his brother George with him, he went to the Island of Barbadoes. His pulmonary trouble had progressed too far to be arrested, and after spending some five months on the Island, and finding himself declining he returned home and died in July, 1752. His marriage had been blessed by four children, three of whom had died, his surviving child, Sarah, was still an infant at the time of her father's death. After providing in his will for his wife he left Mount Vernon to his daughter, but in the event of her death without heirs it was to go to his "beloved brother George," who was also named as one of his executors. This daughter Sarah died within a year, and George inherited Mount Vernon before he was 21 years of age. A few years after Lawrence Washington's death, his widow married George Lee, brother to the father of Arthur and Richard Henry Lee, patriots in the Revolution.
[45] The note book which contains this journal of Washington's includes also other memoranda, such as notes of surveys, drafts of juvenile letters, verses, etc., all of which are of interest for the glimpses they give of the character and early life of their author, and are copied with literal exactness and given with the journal and surveys.

[55]
[46] Frederick county, Virginia, was formed by Act of Assembly in 1738, out of Orange county at the same time that Augusta county was created. The boundaries of Frederick county were measurably well defined; to Augusta, however, was left all the western territory belonging to Virginia, much of it at that time an unexplored wilderness. This immense area has since been divided and now forms four great and independent states of the Union, namely, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois. Frederick county, by a return of the effective militia made to the governor of Virginia in 1777, had but 923 men. The total population of the town of Winchester at that time was 800 and a fraction.—Kercheval.

[47] At this place in the journal three leaves, six pages, have been torn out. The edges left show that they had been written upon by Washington. The next record of a survey in the hand-writing of Washington is signed by him with the name of James Genn, as is also the incomplete plot of a survey here reproduced from the original by tracing; whether it is a study from field notes by James Genn or an actual survey by Washington himself does not appear. The paper upon which it is drawn and the style of the hand-writing, place it as of a date current with the added records of 1747-8.

[48] Alexandria, Virginia.—This seems to be a brief record of the course and distances of a survey by Washington of the shore-line of the town of Alexandria before the river bank was improved or altered by the building of wharves and the grading of streets. It is probable that these lines were run in the winter when the river was closed with ice.

Dear Sir
I should receive a Letter or Letters from you by the first and all oppertunetys with the greatest sense or mark of your esteem and affection whereas its the greatest Pleasure I can yet forsee of having in fairfax to hear from my Intimate friends and acquaintances I hope you in Particular will not Bauk me of what I so ardently Wish for[49]
[49] This appears to have been a study for a letter to some youthful companion. Even to the close of his life it was the habit of Washington, in writing important letters and papers, to make rough drafts of them as a study. However, in copying them off, he frequently changed expressions and amplified their contents as his judgment approved. The original drafts of many of his letters are preserved in the Department of State at Washington and illustrate this fact. Hence the transcripts in his letter-book are not always true copies of either his drafts or his original autograph letters. These drafts were kept by him as memoranda, rather than as exact copies. It is also probable that there are many drafts preserved of letters which were never actually sent. In some cases he endorses this fact upon drafts of letters.
Dear Friend John[50]
As its the greatest mark of friendship and esteem you can shew to an absent Friend In often Writing[58] to him so hope you'l not deny me that Favour as its so ardently wish'd and desired by me its the greatest pleasure I can yet forsee of having in fairfax to hear from my friends Particularly yourself was my affections disengaged I might perhaps form some pleasures in the conversasion of an agreeable Young Lady as theres one now Lives in the same house with me but as that is only nourishment to my former affecn for by often seeing her brings the other into my remembrance whereas perhaps was she not often &amp; (unavoidably) presenting herself to my view I might in some measure eliviate my sorrows by burying the other in the grave of Oblivion I am well convinced my heart stands in defiance of all others but only she thats given it cause enough to dread a second assault and from a different Quarter tho I well know let it have as many attacks as it will from others they cant be more fierce than it has been I could wish to know whether you have taken your intended trip downwards or not if you with what Success as also to know how my friend Lawrence drives on in his art of courtship as I fancy you may both nearlly guess how it will respectively go with each of you
[50] Dear Sir, Dear Friend John, and Dear Friend Robin.—These all seem to be studies or drafts of letters, which may have been impersonal or possibly to his youthful school-fellows and companions in Westmoreland and Stafford counties. It would be idle to speculate as to whom they were intended, in the absence of more definite information. They are in no wise remarkable, except as evidences of Washington's life-long habit of making memoranda, drafts and studies of his letters.

Dear Friend Robin
As its the greatest mark of friendship and esteem absent Friends can shew each other in Writing and often communicating their thoughts to his fellow companions makes me endeavour to signalize myself in acquainting you from time to time and at all times my situation and employments of Life and could Wish you would take half the Pains of contriving me a Letter by any oppertunity as you may be well assured of its meeting with a very welcome reception my Place of Residence is at present at His Lordships where I might was my heart disengag'd pass my time very pleasantly as theres a very agreeable Young Lady Lives in the same house (Colo George Fairfax's Wife's Sister[51]) but as thats only adding Fuel to fire it makes me the more uneasy for by often and unavoidably being in Company with her revives my former Passion for your Low Land Beauty[52] whereas was I to live more retired from yound Women I might in some measure eliviate my sorrows by burying that chast and troublesome Passion in the grave of oblivion or etarnall forgetfulness for as I am very well assured thats the only antidote or remedy that I ever shall be releivd by or only recess that can administer any cure or help to me as I am well convinced was I ever to attempt any thing I should only get a denial which would be only adding grief to uneasiness
[51] The young lady indicated was Miss Mary Cary, the daughter of Colonel Wilson Cary, of Ceeleys Hampton, Elisabeth City county, Va. For 34 years Mr. Cary was collector of customs[60] for the lower James river district, and a man of large wealth and aristocratic notions. He had four daughters: Sarah, who married George W. Fairfax, of "Belvoir"; Mary, who married in 1754, Edward Ambler of Jamestown; Anna, who married Robert Carter Nicholas; and Elizabeth, who married Rev. Bryan, 8th Lord Fairfax. Col. Cary had also one son Wilson Miles Cary, who was a member of the Convention of Virginia in 1776. Some writers have confounded him with his father. Bishop Meade in his Old Churches and Families of Virginia, accepts traditions which other writers claim are authenticated by documents, preserved by the Ambler family, and accordingly his account credits the story that Washington, in his youth, was an ardent admirer of Miss Mary Cary, and solicited leave of Col. Cary to address his daughter, but was refused. (See Meade, vol. i, 108.) This draft of the letter addressed to "Dear Friend Robin," was probably made in the spring of 1748, when Washington was in his seventeenth year. In it, he playfully avows an admiration for the "lowland beauty" and, at the same time, admits the agreeableness of the "young lady in the house" with him at "Belvoir." Mr. Edward Ambler, educated at Cambridge, England, was collector for York river and a burgess for Jamestown. He died in 1768 in his thirty-fifth year and was buried at Jamestown; his widow survived him until 1781. Mrs. Ambler with her children and her sister, Mrs. Fairfax, were occasionally guests at Mount Vernon, as Washington's diaries show. I am inclined to believe that while it is true that Washington entertained a high regard for the Cary family and particularly the ladies, there is nothing but the lightest gossip to create an inference that there ever was even an incipient affair of the heart between either of the Misses Cary and Washington.
[52] Lowland beauty.—Who this object of Washington's early admiration was, if she had a veritable existence, is not positively known. Irving, followed by Everett and others, accepts the tradition, or rather surmises, that this sobriquet referred to Miss Lucy Grymes of Westmoreland county, who in 1753 married Henry Lee, Esq. Their son was the gallant General Henry Lee, "Lighthorse Harry," of the Revolution. Some recent writers, affect to believe that this draft of a letter is conclusive that there was a real love affair but that Betsy[61] Fauntleroy, of Fredericksburg, Va., was the person referred to, and have published a letter purporting to have been addressed by Washington to William Fauntleroy, Sr., Esq., in Richmond, enclosing one to Miss Betsy, who, it is made to appear, had also refused Washington's addresses. Letters and traditions of this character should be received with caution, for while vague reports and surmises of an affair of the heart may be dilated upon in a bantering way among friends of the parties where there is little or no foundation for the allegation, yet they should be subjected to scrutiny and some positive evidence adduced before they are accepted as historical facts.
Dear Sally
This comes to Fredericksburg fair in hopes of meeting with a speedy Passage to you if your not there which hope you'l get shortly altho I am almost discouraged from writing to you as this is my fouth to you since I receiv'd any from yourself I hope you'l not make the Old Proverb good out of sight out of Mind as its one of the greatest Pleasures I can yet foresee of having in Fairfax in often hearing from you hope you'l not deny it me
I Pass the time of much more agreeabler than what I imagined I should as there's a very agreeable Young Lady lives in the same house where I reside (Colo George Fairfax's Wife Sister) that in a great Measure cheats my sorrow and dejectedness tho not so as to draw my thoughts altogether from your Parts I could wish to be with you down there with all my heart but as it is a thing almost Impractakable shall rest myself where I am with hopes of shortly having some Minutes of your transactions in your Parts which will be very welcomely receiv'd by Your

[53] The minuteness of detail is very characteristic of the writer. While Washington was observant of the proprieties of life and of good taste in dress, there was not the least leaning to foppishness. But it was a principle with him to have whatever he bought, consonant with good taste and of the best quality.
[54] At this point in the book there are 18 blank pages.
Dear Richard
The Receipt of your kind favour of the 2d of this Instant afforded me unspeakable pleasure as I am convinced I am still in the Memory of so Worthy a friend a friendship I shall ever be proud of Increasing you gave me the more pleasure as I receiv'd it amongst a parcel of Barbarians and an uncooth set of People the like favour often repeated would give me Pleasure[63] altho I seem to be in a Place where no real satis: is to be had since you receid my Letter in October Last I have not sleep'd above three Nights or four in a bed but after Walking a good deal all the Day lay down before the fire upon a Little Hay Straw Fodder or bearskin whichever is to be had with Man Wife and Children like a Parcel of Dogs or Catts &amp; happy's he that gets the Birth nearest the fire there's nothing would make it pass of tolerably but a good Reward a Dubbleloon is my constant gain every Day that the Weather will permit my going out and some time Six Pistoles[55] the coldness of the Weather will not allow my making a long stay as the Lodging is rather too cold for the time of Year I have never had my Cloths of but lay and sleep in them like a Negro except the few Nights I have lay'n in Frederick Town.
[55] A Pistole.—This coin was worth, at the time Washington wrote this journal, about $3.60. A doubloon was worth twice that amount.
Mem To Survey the Lands at the Mouth of Little Cacapehon[56] &amp; the Mouth of Fifteen Mile Creek[57] for the Gentlemen of the Ohio Com:[58]
[56] Cacapehon, now generally written Capon.—There are two streams in the same vicinity known by this name, and to distinguish them, one is called "Great Capon" and the other "Little Capon." Both are tributaries to the Potomac.
[57] Fifteen Mile creek rises in Maryland and flows in a south-easterly direction, emptying into the Potomac river between Sideling Hill creek and Town creek, about 15 miles above Hancock, Md.
[64]
[58] "The Ohio Company" grew into existence out of efforts by Virginians, dated as early as 1746 or 1747, to secure a share in the lucrative Indian trade, and with the prospect of opening to settlement the lands on the upper waters of the Ohio. An early move in this direction had been made by Colonel Thomas Cresap, a man of courage, judgment and enterprise—qualities required for trading successfully with the Indians. He had erected his cabin at Oldtown, Md. About 1746 Lawrence and Augustine Washington, after making some cautious business ventures in the Indian trade, with others assisted to organize "this Ohio Company." Thomas Lee, whose second son, Richard Henry Lee, was to become so conspicuous a patriot of the Revolution, and John Hanbury, a wealthy London merchant, were original members of this company, into which still other men of substance and standing were admitted, and to which, in 1749, the British government gave a charter, as "The Ohio Company," with a grant of half a million acres of land, to be located between the Monongahela and Kanawha rivers, on the south side of the Ohio. With but twenty shares of stock at first issue, the company's prosperity seemed assured, and both Governor Dinwiddie and George Mason, at a later date purchased an interest in it. Among the early Washington manuscripts appears the above memorandum of a survey for this company. Although this entry is without date it must have been earlier, judging from its position in the note-book, than the charter. This document imposed, as conditions of the land grant, that the company should at once survey two hundred thousand acres, and within seven years secure the settlement of not less than one hundred families, erect forts, and maintain a garrison against the Indians,—conditions on the fulfilment of which they were to be for ten years exempt from the payment of quit-rents. Mr. Christopher Gist was employed as the company's agent, and on October 19, 1749, entered upon his duties of inspecting the country, contiguous to the Ohio river, reporting upon the character of the lands, making surveys, keeping a journal of his observations, drawing plans of the territory, etc. In 1750 the company built a small store-house at Will's creek and stocked it with goods from London to the value of £4,000. In 1752 Mr. Gist held a council with the Indians on the Ohio in behalf of the company, and secured their permission to lay out a town and erect a fort at McKee's[65] Rocks at the mouth of Chartier's creek, upon the east side of the Ohio, a few miles below Pittsburg. Washington, in his diary, alludes to this, and says of the position: "I think it greatly inferior, either for defense or advantage, especially the latter: For a fort at the forks would be equally well situated on the Ohio, and have the entire command of the Monongahela." In 1751 the company began making a road to the mouth of the Monongahela, but for lack of adequate resources, made only slow progress. The company looked upon the lands around Will's creek as being within their grant. They also erected a store-house at the mouth of Redstone on the Monongahela and began some improvements at the forks of the Ohio, immediately after completing those at Will's creek. At the latter place they had the adjacent lands surveyed on both sides the stream, above and below the forks, and laid out a town to which they gave the name of Charlottesburg in honor of the Princess Charlotte, afterward wife of King George. The French and Indian war, with other stirring political events, compelled the company to be cautious and to contract its operations, but, its embarrassments increasing from the course pursued toward it by the English government, prompted by envious rival interests, the consent of its agent, George Mercer, Esq., was finally gained to merge the Ohio Company into a Grand Company, under what was known as the Walpole Grant or Company. Their proposal was as follows: "We, the Committee of the Purchasers of a Tract of Country for a new Province on the Ohio in America, do hereby admit the Ohio Company as a Co-Purchaser with us for two shares of the said Purchase,* in Consideration of the Engagement of their Agent, Col. Mercer, to withdraw the application of the said Company for a separate Grant within the Limits of the said Purchase.
Witness our Hands this 7th Day of May 1770
* The whole being divided into seventy-two equal Shares by the words "two shares" above is understood two Seventy-second parts of the Tract so as above Purchased.

This action, however, was not approved by the American[66] members of the company, and the final collapse of the whole enterprise was one of the results of the Revolution.

[59] Memorandum or draft of a letter to his sister-in-law Anne, wife of Lawrence Washington, of Mount Vernon, made, very possibly, while in the field surveying in the fall of 1748 or spring of 1749. This visit to Europe, of Lawrence Washington, was partly in the interest of the Ohio Company and partly on account of his failing health which, unfortunately, was not benefited by the voyage as had been hoped.

[60] Mrs. Aus. Washington evidently refers to Mrs. Augustine Washington, of Westmoreland, the wife of George's half-brother, Augustine, with whom he had made his home while attending Mr. William's Academy. Austin is, or has been, in Virginia a contraction for Augustine. Augustine Moore, a notable character, is recorded interchangeably, in land and other records, as Augustine and as Austin Moore. It is presumed that "The Maryland Housewife" was intended to have been written, that being the name of a popular book on cookery and the art of housekeeping at that period. The date of this memorandum[67] is presumed to be 1748. A charge in his book of accounts kept at this time, and which was among the relics of Lawrence Washington sold in Philadelphia in the spring of 1891, would fix the date as July 28th, 1748. It was not an unusual thing for Washington in his youth to use contractions in writing the first names of his brothers, the following are examples: Aus., Austin for Augustine; Sam for Samuel; Jack and John, simply for John Augustine.

[61] This is about the only record Washington has left of his course of reading. It is inferred that the books were either at "Greenway Court" or at "Belvoir." The character of the works he selected for his perusal is what might have been expected. This memorandum also exhibits a trait in his character prominent throughout his life, that of giving attention to minute details of business. It may truly be said of him that "the boy was father to the man."
[62] Honorable William Fairfax, of "Belvoir," Fairfax county, Va., was born 1691 in Yorkshire, England, where his father that year became high sheriff of the county. His father was the son of Henry Fairfax, 2d son of 4th Lord Fairfax and Anna (Harrison) Fairfax, whose sister, Eleanora Harrison, of South Cave, married in 1689, Henry Washington; their son, Richard Washington, who resided in London, was, therefore, an English cousin of Wm. Fairfax, and a correspondent both of his and of Col. George Washington's (see Washington's correspondence,[68] in Sparks). Wm. Fairfax lost his father when quite young and was educated at his uncle's, Sir John Lowther's College. Through the influence of Capt. Fairfax, of the Royal Navy, he entered that service in 1710 and served for two years. He then joined the British army in Spain under Col. Martin Bladen, who had married a Fairfax, and was stationed at St. Helena in 1716-17, and subsequently at the Bahamas, and returned to England in October, 1717. Having married in the Bahamas, Sarah, daughter of Maj. Walker, of Nassau, she accompanied him to England. In 1718 Wm. Fairfax was sent out with Captain or Governor Woodes Rogers as chief justice to suppress the pirates infesting the West Indies. His residence was at Nassau, New Providence. The business for which he accepted office having been completed and the climate not being congenial, he in 1725 removed to New England. Here he received an appointment to the custom house at Salem, which he held until 1734. While a resident of Salem, his first wife died and was buried there. His son George William was born in Nassau, three of his children were born in Salem. Thomas, of the Royal Navy, was killed in battle; Anne married Lawrence Washington, and was the first mistress of Mount Vernon; and Sarah married John Carlyle, of Alexandria, Va., who was a major and commissary in the French and Indian war. Mr. Fairfax married, January 18, 1731, Deborah Clarke, of Salem, Mass. Her first child was Bryan, 8th Lord Fairfax, born at Salem 1732, but better known as the Rev. Bryan Fairfax, who died in 1802. In 1734 Wm. Fairfax accepted an offer, he had before declined, to remove to Virginia and act as agent for his cousin, Lord Thomas Fairfax, in the management of the vast Fairfax land estate. He at first took up his residence in Westmoreland county and remained there for several years, but afterward improved the plantation, built "Belvoir" mansion, six miles below "Mount Vernon," and removed to it. He was residing there in 1739, when Lord Fairfax first visited Virginia and made it his home for a year. Wm. Fairfax, from his high character and acquaintance with business, soon came to the front among the leading men in Virginia. Besides being agent for his cousin, he served in the assembly of Virginia, and after the death of John Blair was president of the Provincial council and collector of his majesty's customs for the South Potomac. His second wife bore him two children, besides Bryan[69] already mentioned, William Henry, killed at the storming of Quebec in 1759; and Hannah, who married Warner Washington, cousin to George Washington. William Fairfax was a man of great executive ability and much beloved by the community. He died September 3, 1757. His wife survived him but a few years. "Belvoir" was left to George W. Fairfax and was his residence until he went to England in 1773.

[63] The razor in colonial days was an essential part of a gentleman's toilet outfit. Washington had a strong beard and was early called upon to use his razor. Long, full beards were not then in fashion in America. It is a notable fact that there is not a portrait extant of an American-born patriot or statesman of the Revolutionary period, painted with a full beard. This memorandum, although not dated, is believed to have been written in 1748. The clean shaven face was constrained by the fashion of the continent; and prevailed as the custom in England and France for a period of quite 75 years.

[65] A kind of shirt collar.
[66] Neck Cloths.—These were usually made of fine white cambric, folded wide, were wrapped twice around the neck and worn without collars.
[67] Caps.—The number here will attract attention considering the list of other articles; but it must be remembered that it was the custom at that period for both men and women to wear caps at night in bed. At the time when this journal was written,[70] bed rooms were not heated, hence the custom of warming beds before retiring in winter, and the necessity for wearing night caps is more apparent, and, further, the head was frequently shaven and wigs were worn during the day by many. It is the tradition that Patrick Henry wore at home, in the day, even, when not in full dress, a "tarred cotton cap," whilst in public he wore a wig. In speaking, when he was earnestly moved, a striking emphasis of his is said to have been a rapid whirling of his wig around his head.

[69] The poetical effusions of George Washington are neither numerous nor notable. The specimens here given are found on the spare pages of his memoranda mixed in with his notes of surveys. Some leaves are missing at this point and the concluding lines of one poem, at least, are lost.

[70] Land warrants were granted by the Crown, by the Legislature or its authorized agent, and by the governors of the provinces. A warrant had the character of a commission and guaranteed title. Land warrants issued in accordance with law were negotiable, and when laid and the survey plotted by a licensed surveyor and recorded in the land office, were maintained by the courts as against all other claimants.
The following is an exact copy of an order from G. W. Fairfax, agent of Lord Fairfax, for the sale of unseated lands in the "Northern Neck of Virginia" to George Washington a licensed surveyor in Virginia as his warrant to survey a particular parcel of land. The original document was in the possession of J. A. Russell, Esq., of New York city, in 1869, and is published in the Historical Magazine for March of that year, p. 197:—
"To Mr. G. Washington
"Whereas, Barthalamore Anderson, of Frederick County hath Informed that there are about Four hundred 50 Acres of Waste and Ungranted Land in the said County, formerly granted to Thomas Morgan by Jost Hite as p. Bond for the same &amp; by Assignment to the sd Anderson, on Arnold's Run a branch of Shenandoah.
"And Desiring a Warrant to survey the same in order to obtain a Deed, being ready to Pay the Composition and Office Charges.
"These are therefore to Empower You the sd G. Washington to survey the sd Waste Land.

[71] Lost River.—This stream gets its name from the fact that for three miles it passes out of sight under a mountain which lies across its course. It rises in Hardy county, W. Va., and flows in a north-easterly direction to the Cacapehon river. The following diagram is made from a pen drawing by Washington in his field note book, but not definitely related to this particular survey.

I went Last Tuesday not knowing your Lordship had that very Day set out for Neavils to see whether you had any further Commands or directions to give concerning the Surveying of Cacapehon and as your Lordship was not at Home I was inform by Colo G. Fairfax that you had not any Directions in Particular more than were given to the other Surveyors as your Lordship had mentioned I therefore have made bold to Proceed on General Directions from him as[74] Missing this Opportunity of Good Weather may be of considerable Hindrance I shall Wait on your Lordship at Frederick Court in November to obey your further Pleasure and am my Lord &amp;[72]
[72] Here terminates the entries in the little note book, containing "My Journey Over the Mountains." It is proper to state that the journal was kept in a small, vellum-bound, blank book, 6 by 3¾ inches in size, closely written on both sides of the leaf. Either from a desire to classify his memoranda, or for want of a second book, or from some motive of economy, he turned the book around and began from the other end to keep a record more particularly relating to his surveys and miscellaneous affairs. His field notes of surveys were kept in a book of the same size as the one described, from which the most of the following surveys are taken. The other surveys are found on loose sheets which have been bound and denominated miscellaneous papers; a few of them having dates, enables the editor to place them in chronological order.

[75] For this survey Washington received the sum of £2 3s 0d on the 25th of July, 1749, as shown by entry in his cash book; a copy of which is in the Toner Collection, Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.
[76] Culpeper county, Virginia, was formed by act of assembly in 1748, and named in honor of Lord Thomas Culpeper, governor of Virginia from 1682 to 1686. The old family name was spelled with two p's, but in using the name as a locality one p is dropped. Its original form, however, was Colepeper. The widow of Lord Culpeper spelled her name and wrote it, "Mar. Culpeper—Leeds Castle, Dec. 19, 1706." Lord Culpeper and Lord Arlington had obtained from Charles II in 1672 a grant of proprietary rights over the whole of Virginia, but within a short time, in consequence of resistance by the colonists, surrendered all except quit rents and escheats, and a duty of three half-pence per pound on tobacco. Two years after ceasing to be governor, Lord Culpeper, who had become by purchase sole owner of the grant, further abandoned all his rights except that of property in the lands of that part of the Northern Neck beyond the Blue Ridge, with an annual pension of £600 for twenty years in lieu of what he gave up. This estate of about 5,700,000 acres of land in the Shenandoah valley and the mountains beyond, went to his daughter and heiress, Catherine, who became the wife of Thomas, the 5th Lord Fairfax, and from her to their son Thomas the 6th, and the first American Lord Fairfax of Washington's time. Lord Culpeper had been one of the commissioners of plantations under Charles II, and was a man of ability for business and public affairs, although rapacious; and, as governor, wholly British, without that sympathy for Virginia interest, such as Berkeley, with all his faults, had shown. The county of Culpeper, however, was conspicuous for the patriotism of its inhabitants during the Revolution. Her "minute men," Randolph said on the floor of the United States Senate, "were raised in a minute, armed in a minute, marched in a minute, fought in a minute, and vanquished in a minute." The motto on their flag was, "The Culpeper Minute Men," along the top border; in the center a curled rattlesnake with head erect and rattling tail; on either side the words "Liberty—or Death;" and beneath, along the lower border, "Don't [78] Tread on Me." In the clerk's office of Culpeper court house is recorded the following: "20 July, 1749 [O. S.] George Washington, Gent., produced a commission from the President and Master of William and Mary College, appointing him to be surveyor of this county, which was read, and thereupon he took the usual oaths," etc.
[77] Washington, S. C. C.—This is supposed to be an official check mark signature of George Washington as a licensed surveyor of Culpeper county. The plat of this survey is published by Sparks, vol. 1, p. 14, and is reproduced here, as the editor has failed, so far, in finding the original among any of the Washington papers extant. The plat bears date two days after he filed his certificate and took the necessary oath before the court in Culpeper county referred to in the preceding note.

[78] Augusta county, and also Frederick county, were formed in 1738, out of Orange county which, prior to that date, had embraced all of Virginia beyond the Blue Ridge. The bounds of Frederick were defined as follows: the Potomac on the north, the Blue Ridge on the east, and on the south and west a line drawn from the head spring of the Hedgman creek to the head spring of the Potomac; all beyond this line, comprising the immense western territory belonging to Virginia, constituted Augusta county. The earliest Frederick county court was held at Winchester, Nov. 11, 1743; and that of Augusta county was held at Beverley's Mill Place, now Staunton, Dec. 9, 1745.
[79] The notes of the survey of land, on the 22d July, 1749, for Richard Barnes, and that of November 12, 1749, for Edward Hogan, were recorded on sheets of foolscap paper, and are bound up with other early miscellaneous papers of George Washington, preserved in the Department of State. They are here given nearly in their chronological place.

[82] This survey has a cross drawn over its face and the following words added after the date: this Card to Fo 82. It is probable that some error had discovered itself when an attempt was made to draw a plat by the metes and bounds as given. As this illustrates Washington's careful attention to details, it is given just as he left it.

[83] One of the natural curiosities of West Virginia is "Caudy's Castle," named presumably for this individual, who, Kercheval says, had taken refuge from the Indians on the summit of a stupendous detached rock standing out from a precipitous mountain side and having an elevation of several hundred feet. It is situated a couple of miles above the forks of Capon.

OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

The colonies of New York (West of the Hudson, Manhattan, &amp; Long Island), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are consolidated into the Province of Pennsylvania. The Western border was fixed with Charlotina where Pennsylvania remain East of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers and Charlotina is to the West. A true North-South line is drawn from the easternmost end of Lake Erie to the Allegheny River.
Pennsylvania divided their Provincial Assembly seats equally among the former colonies. There is friction as Manhattan &amp; Long Island seek to be independent.

This section discusses the application of slower-than-light (STL) space travel. As IRL, **Strand** space travel involves use of reaction drives, though Toltec technology accelerated the development of very efficient drives.

##### Edison Drives

&lt;!-- * S-250 Series Epstein Drive: A UN drive used on Leonidas-class battleships. This drive is older and less efficient than most current drive models.
* S-400 Series Epstein Drive: A UN drive used on Truman-class dreadnoughts.
* Bush shipyards Black Ops supercooled Epstein drive - CODENAME Silversmith: A drive built on Luna and secretly used on the Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates owned by Protogen.
* RT-10 'Kaminari' Epstein Drive: MCR drive used on Donnager-class battleships.
* RTF-B Series Epstein Drive: MCR drive used on Scirocco-class Assault cruisers.
* RT6-B Epstein Drive: MCR drive used on Morrigan-class Patrol destroyers.
* G-4000 Series Epstein Drive: A very large drive used on the Nauvoo/Behemoth. --&gt;

##### Spacecraft

&lt;!-- Do not break the reaction-based system to keep him on the planet. --&gt;

**Design.** Spacecraft are symmetrically built around a frame. Propulsion is reaction-based, so a considerable amount of the ship's total mass is its consumable reaction material. Ships cannot travel in atmosphere as gravity will crush the frame. Travel between planet and orbitals is done through interface vehicles. **Ships are built like office towers** (Pringles cans), with small decks stacked on top of each other, which experience gravity only when the ship is under thrust.

**Travel.** When traveling, ships accelerate to the midpoint of their journey, turn around, and decelerate. No dogfights, no Immelmann or Crazy Ivan maneuvers. Safe travel means accelerating to a midpoint at 1.0-1.5 G, turn around, decelerate at 1.0-1.5 G, over a period of several days.

**Maneuvering.** Maneuver drives use liquid nitrogen or water heated to boiling point.

**Heat.** Heat is always a problem. An inability to dissipate heat can get one into trouble. Burn your engines too much, or fire too many lasers, and you start to have problems in combat yourself, because of an inability to radiate heat into the darkness of space.

**Payload.** These concerns combine to suggest that a ships payload section is relatively small (10-30% of the ship’s mass), Given the limits on payload, space for crew, weapons, cargo, and extras is limited. Slipdrives are small to allow FTL travel within the design constraints (i.e. we wanted ships both with slipdrives and with guns), and so the limit on FTL travel comes from the point of departure, well above the ecliptic of the system.

            <Text>##### Government of British America

In 1754, Benjamin Franklin proposed what became known as the Albany Plan[^albany-plan]. This plan proposed a Grand Council which essentially gave British North America home rule. While the plan was rejected, it was the basis of the negotiated reconciliation between British North America and Britain. These privileges were not extended to the British West Indies, leading to some friction with the Indies that was mitigated by the Indies planters establishing residences in Carolina.[^OTL-Albany Plan]

[^OTL-Albany Plan]: OTL: Benjamin Franklin proposed the plan at the Albany Congress at the age of 46. The plan was rejected both by the colonies and Parliament. Elements of this Plan recurred during the Continental Congress.

The **Council of British North America** represented the split interests of the former colonies, Crown and Parliament. It was bicameral, with the House of Representatives comprising provincial delegates appointed by the provincial assemblies. As with the Albany Plan, each province was given between two and seven seats based upon the _proportional amount of revenue_ they provided to the Commonwealth. House of Ministers represented a smaller body of ministers appointed by Parliament to consult on legislation from the House of Representatives, with one minister appointed per province. The Council (also known as the Grand Council) managed local affairs between the provinces and local Indian tribes. Parliament retained right of refusal provided they acted within three years of the legislation.

Internal provincial legislation is managed via **Provincial Assemblies**. Each Assembly was bicameral, with the House of Lords appointing the Council of State and province landowners electing members of the Council of Commons. The Crown appoints a Lieutenant Governor as executive to each Province, as well as the Governor of British America. Each provincial government appoints 9 seats to the British Parliament, for a total of 54 seats in the Commons. Compare this with the 45 seats given to Scotland in 1707.

The result of this governmental structure is that the legislatures are dominated by local oligarchies. These oligarchs jealously defend their power, thus quieting the American Troubles, and largely followed the Lords' suggestions.

The British America Act of 1771 restructured British America (the continent) into six provinces: Canada, New England, Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York), Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia. This led to six Provincial Assemblies. This led to a significant amount of internal tension within all but Georgia.

### Weapons Development

Weapons development in the 19th Century accelerated based on access to working Toltec weapons. Toltecs continued to use slug-throwing weapons, so this accelerates the introduction of semi- and full-automatic weaponry. Based on the Neutrino discoveries, scientists speculate the Toltec withheld their more advanced weaponry from Earth.

#### Personal Weapons

Several weapons were found in the Toltec Indian Mound Temple. Anglo-American first reverse-engineered the actual weapon as the first generation. A second iteration led to improvements.

----------  ------------------------------------------------------------

  1803      Pennsylvania Toltec Arms, Ltd. (PTA Ltd.) chartered
            by Jacob Dickert and Martin Meylin Jr. to reverse-engineer
            &amp; produce Toltec weapons, moved by royal request to Harper's Ferry.
  1807      First successful reverse-engineered prototype built
  1814      PTA Ltd. completed 4,000 rifles Harper's Ferry Model 1803,
            a.k.a. Toltec Battle Rifle Model '03 (HFM-03, TBRM-03 or BRM-03)
            Essentially the StG-44. This is a straight reverse-engineer.
  1815      Battle of Waterloo turned by use of the BRM-03
  1815      PTA Ltd. charter revoked. Crown forms "Harpers Ferry Arsenal"
            with the same leadership
  1819      The Model 1819 (M1819, AK-47) "Hall Rifle" replaces the BRM-03
  1808-17   Semi-automatic pistols reverse engineered and improved,
            essentially the boxy Glock is the improved result.

#### Field Artillery

The cannon was quickly replaced by what we would consider modern field artillery.

### Central Theme

Stories were first told for two reasons: entertainment and education. [The Epic of Gilgamesh](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh) was the story of a hero who kicked ass and took names, but it was also a celebration of the culture that produced it, one of the first.

Different from [An Aesop](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop) in that the [Central Theme](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme) is often a question or a general topic rather than a direct precept or conclusion: where an Aesop is a specific moral that is explicated and forced on the audience, a Central Theme will more likely be explored, analyzed, and [Played With](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith). For example, "[The Power of Friendship](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship)" or (even better) "The struggles of sustaining The Power of Friendship [in a cold, harsh world](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld)" are themes in that they are questions or issues that the author is interested in exploring and/or wants the reader to think about, whereas "The Power of Friendship will ultimately overcome all obstacles" is an Aesop in that it is a lesson or conclusion the author wants the reader to take away from the work. Of course, there can be a fine line between them, and the central theme can and often is used to develop and deliver the Aesop, but they are not strictly speaking the same.

Using our example above as a demonstration, the writer may have constructed a story that examines the difficulties of sustaining The Power of Friendship in a cold, harsh world (theme), only to ultimately reach the conclusion that The Power of Friendship will always prevail (Aesop). The reader may disagree with the author's conclusion, but regardless, the work will still be about the difficulties of sustaining The Power of Friendship, and there's nothing the reader can do to change that.

Put simply, the Aesop is the what the author wants the reader to *learn*. The Central Theme is what the story is fundamentally *about*.

Also compare [Motif](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Motif), a more general term for a recurring [symbol](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Symbolism) or idea throughout a work, different from Central Theme in that it is not the story's main focus. Another distinction is that a Central Theme is *usually* a broad, expansive topic—love, time, mortality—while Motifs are generally smaller and more specific.

A good place to start thinking about the theme of the work is the conflict it depicts; what is the overall conflict of the story, where does it originate, and what questions or thinking points does this conflict prompt?

Go to a work's [Analysis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Analysis) sub-page to find a more detailed exploration of its central theme — or add your own insight. As always, however, be wary of [seeing messages where there are none](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotDidactic).

            <Text>Blood Knight
“…HAVE AT THEE!”
Fighting is everything to the Blood Knight. He lives for it. It’s not so much about winning or losing, morality, the motives of his allies, or even the glory, that drives this guy so much as it is the opportunity for a good fight.
A Blood Knight can be of any morality whatsoever, although Anti Heroes and Anti Villains tend to be most common.
Heroic examples will frequently be The Big Guy in an ensemble, the character most likely to solve his problems by force of arms. They might make the less violent members of the crew a little nervous, especially if they go off on a hair trigger. He may merely enjoy the challenge and not hurting others necessarily; some don’t hurt people unprovoked since they have a sense of right and wrong.
The Blood Knight doesn’t even have to be a particularly violent man most of the time. A common version found in Eastern fiction is the Wandering Martial Artist, who Wanders the Earth looking for strong opponents to test his skills against. This might be coupled with a love of fair duels and a desire to challenge the best and strongest. This type still enjoys the thrill of the fight, but usually eschews the death and bloodshed aspect. A living opponent, after all, can improve their skills and provide an even better challenge later. Defeat Means Friendship is a common occurrence with these guys, their opponent’s or their own.
As an antagonist, he has a good chance of being an Anti-Villain, since he doesn’t want to kill the heroes, necessarily, just fight them. If he can find someone tough enough to beat him he might undergo a Heel–Face Turn and join the hero’s team, or simply gain a newfound respect for his foe that he didn’t have before. He might deliberately disadvantage himself in order to make fights last longer and loves to reveal that he is not left-handed. Despite the brutality that this trope implies, it’s not uncommon for them to be a Noble Demon as well when they want an exciting fight on specific terms or when they reject unfair advantages because it would make the fight no fun. He may even betray his boss if he insists on interfering to pursue and obsess over his foe on his own terms. Less pleasant ones may do all kinds of horrible things to provoke their opponents into fighting them. Though if they specifically love to kill (rather than fight) they are a Psycho for Hire.
Personality-wise, more evil ones may be a Flat Character (and quite possibly The Brute) who just shouts “Maim! Kill! Burn!”. Good/Sympathetic ones are usually more sophisticated/developed and can have aspects of the Warrior Therapist, Warrior Poet or Cultured Warrior. He might be a normal, jocular guy when he’s not brawling, or he might take the fight so seriously that he blocks out everything else and will therefore live only for battle. In some cases, the Blood Knight fights because he’s looking for a way to die with meaning.
A War God is very often one of these though he could also be Ax-Crazy or just The Sociopath. If there’s a whole society of guys who like combat, you’ve got a Proud Warrior Race. If the character likes the ‘killing’ part more than the ‘fighting’ part, they’re a Psycho for Hire. The Egomaniac Hunter also thrives on aimless violent thrill and loves a worthy quarry instead of an opponent. If a character is in it for the challenge rather than just the fight, then we’ve got a Spirited Competitor. The Blood Knight’s love of combat may be platonic, or it may have sexual undertones. It could also overlap with Ax-Crazy if their love of fighting crosses the line into psychopathic violence and mental and emotional instability.
Sub-Trope of In Harm’s Way. Sister Trope to Combat Sadomasochist, The Real Man, and Boisterous Bruiser. Compare Cavalier Competitor and, for a more general trope, Challenge Seeker. Also compare Sadist, whose favorite part of fighting is the pain and suffering of his opponent. May be from a Martyrdom Culture and will nearly always believe that War Is Glorious. If he (or she, though it’s much rarer, however; see Lady of War) is in the military, then he will almost inevitably be a Colonel Kilgore. A Monster Knight has a high chance of being one. A more violent example that nonetheless fights on the side of good may (or may not) be a Sociopathic Hero. It also has nothing to do with a knight who uses Blood Magic. Contrast Shell-Shocked Veteran, who is of the opposite mindset (also contrast War Is Hell).
Oh, just in case it wasn’t clear, the character doesn’t have to be a literal knight for this trope to apply. It is about the attitude, not the rank.
Blood Knight / Playing With
Basic Trope: Someone who enjoys fighting.
•	Straight: Bob loves a good fight and picks a profession that allows him to seek out worthy opponents and enjoys proving his skills against them in battle.
•	Exaggerated:
–	Bob cannot go a week without getting into some kind of fight just to alleviate boredom if nothing else.
–	Bob starts a religion where brutally murdering your enemy is the best way for his salvation. And for the salvation of his enemies. Or Bob uses elements of “sacred sexuality” like in Tantrism, but replaces everything sexual with the joy of killing his enemies.
•	Downplayed: Bob enjoys fighting against skilled opponents, but doesn’t go out of his way to seek them out.
•	Justified:
–	As a member of a militaristic culture that glorified warfare and prowess of the battlefield, Bob is merely acting according to his culture’s expectations of a good warrior.
–	He started out his rampage as a revenge, but in the end, he ended up obsessed with fighting.
–	He spills the others’ blood to ease his thirst. And since nutrition is a pleasure on itself…
–	Combat provides a massive adrenaline rush. Bob fights to get the ultimate high.
•	Subverted: Bob enjoys proving his skill on the battlefield until he meets an opponent that grossly outclasses him in terms of skill. He then finds that fighting is less fun when you’re getting your ass kicked.
•	Double Subverted: Bob’s beatdown motivates him to train harder so he can defeat his opponent.
•	Parodied: Everytime Bob hears about a fight, he immediately goes berserk and runs at the place to start yelling “KILLBURNKILL!!!” and swinging the first heavy object he found and picked up left and right.
•	Zig Zagged: Whether or not Bob is enjoying a fight depends on a variety of factors, sometimes he’s having the time of his life, other times he’s just as stressed as everyone else.
•	Averted: Bob may be a warrior, but he doesn’t enjoy fighting in the slightest
•	Enforced:
–	The writer wants to portray the negative aspects of being obsessed with violence.
–	The writer finds “he goes looking for fights” more realistic as a plot device than “all the fights come to him”.
•	Implied: Whenever Bob is in open combat, he seems much more relaxed than in everyday situations.
•	Lampshaded:
–	“It’s been like four days since anybody needed me to punch them. I. Am. So. BORED.”
–	“Doesn’t he have another fun in his life?”
•	Invoked: Bob was raised from birth to love fighting and violence so that he could serve as The Heavy for the local Big Bad.
•	Exploited: Bob is easy to manipulate, because his love of fighting gets in the way of his critical thinking when it comes to things like “Should I be fighting this guy in the first place?”
•	Defied: Bob isn’t hesitant about fighting when it’s necessary, but refuses to let it become something he enjoys for its own sake.
•	Discussed: “If there’s anything I’ve learned, Enyo, it’s that if you show yourself to be strong, you’ll have people lining up to fight. Thus, I want everyone to know how strong you are, so I can find a few combat-addicts to help further defend my plans.”
•	Conversed: “People who like fighting are always written as battle-lusty maniacs — as in, literally, they all but cum in battle, and in an X-rated show they go that far, too. It’s always like that. You’d think writers would give them a bit more nuance nowadays.”
•	Deconstructed:
–	Bob’s tendencies to seek out worthy opponents leads to him getting killed.
–	Bob’s love of battle leads him to escalate a situation that could have easily been defused peacefully. He is abandoned by his comrades after the destruction his actions indirectly caused.
–	The person he fights for publically begs him to stop fighting.
•	Reconstructed:
–	Bob knows his aggressive tendencies put him at risk of doing something stupid, so he emphasizes self-control and learns to enjoy his moments of delayed gratification.
–	Bob is a Martial Pacifist who deeply enjoys fighting, but also knows that there is a time and place for it.
–	In the end, Bob loses everything, he gets ostracised by everyone he wanted to defend, gets betrayed and outright killed. Hundred years later, even his enemies consider him a hero because he fought for what he believed, no matter the cost, and risked everything for his values.
•	Played For Laughs: Bob treats fighting like any other form of entertainment. When everyone goes to the cinema, he goes to the boxing club, and going to war is his idea of a perfect vacation.
•	Played For Drama:
–	Bob can seldom find any enjoyment in anything other than combat. Despite having been injured multiple times and being ridden by guilt over the times he had to kill someone, he continues to do the only thing that, in his opinion, makes his life worth living.
–	Bob is a Death Seeker who can’t commit suicide because it would be dishonorable. Therefore he tries to find someone who can kill him in a fight.
•	Played For Horror: Bob is shown laughing with joy, while his fallen enemies scream in pain at his feet.</Text>

            <Text>Khēmía Habitat
The Khēmía Habitat is a precursor orbital in a geostationary orbit over a goldilocks rockball; tending to be directly over a “Western” continent. See the specific orbitals in Season 3.
A Khēmía Habitat is a hexagonal, rotating wheel space station, 617 feet in diameter. The hexagon is 34’ high and comprises three decks: Outer, Medial and Inner. The decks are outward due to the spin-created artificial gravity. Each deck has 8’ high ceilings, with three feet between decks for mechanical. The width of the hexagon has a 4:9 ratio with the diameter, with the Outer deck being 137’ “across the beam” and the Inner deck being 127’ wide.
From the surface of Elysion, the space station’s angular diameter is 1/2 the size of Jupiter’s Europa, making it impractical to detect with telescopes under 60 power.
External ship access is accessed via the central hub, itself 59 feet across. The hub is connected to the hexagon via three spokes; each labeled Alpha, Beta and Gamma. The hexagon comprises three decks, Outer, Medial and Inner, each being roughly 11 feet high.
Gravity is created by the Habitat’s spin (π rpm). The Medial deck has an effective gravity of 1G, with the Outer and Inner off ± 0.3G. SpinCalc. https://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/). Accessed February 20, 2020.

            <Text>David Strand
Overview. Bubba is a (DESCRIPTIVE PHRASE). For him, life is a (WORLDVIEW). Others say he is best known for (ACCOMPLISHMENT). When people first meet him, they notice his (PHYSICAL TRAITS AND PERSONALITY), then they notice that (TRAITS THAT ADD OR CONTRADICTs DOMINANT TRAITS). Because of (TRAGEDY), he needs to prove that (LIE). He fears that (FEAR) and will (FLAW / COMPETING) to prevent it.
David Strand
Summary. One-sentence summary of series from character’s perspective. One-paragraph expansion in ~8 sentences. David got into trouble in a local village, and fled into the wilderness…closely pursued by villagers. He climbed up a steep hill, only to slip and fall through a small opening into a space beyond. This is the Toltec discovery. His tinkering and blacksmithing skills led him to figure out how to operate the alien rifle, which is similar to an Enfield. He grabs a tablet, rifle and cube, and slips out of the temple. He tries to get past the villagers, but they detect him and the pursuit resumes…until he uses the rifle to kill 2 of the 7. The fast firing scares the other five (3 of whom are wounded). He finds his way back to Meadville.        He is spared the noose by a contraption under his arms (butterfly knot), allowing him to escape.
David hopes the discovery will make it easier for America to separate from England. Henry disagrees with David both in the ability and in the politics, but he doesn’t tell David of the political disagreement. Henry works to make the murder go away, while trying to find from David where the Mound was.
Physical.      
Emotional. David Strand would say he is a [adjective] [noun]      
Personality.          David &amp; Henry Strand are closely related brothers. Both are keenly intelligent, but David is stronger and Henry is more even-tempered. The first season is about these two “discovering” Toltec technology and ultimately of David being brought to justice. This is an Esau / Jacob story.  
Tragedy.  One-paragraph summary of Bubba’s personal tragedy that fuels his Fear, Lie, Wound, Flaw and Desire.
David Strand was born in 1757 in Coventry, Connecticut (later New England) into a large family, the son of Lucy and Michael Strand, a blacksmith. His half-brother, Henry Strand, was an Associate Justice of the Superior Court of New England. After attending Coventry Grammar School, David Strand attended Yale College in nearby New Haven, Connecticut, where he was a member of the Linonian Society.[^Linonian Society] He graduated in 1775.
Three years later after theological study, he was licensed as a Congregationalist minister. He also served as a tutor at the college. He held that position until 1779. During his time at Yale, he fell in with the Sons of Liberty separatist group, who sought independence from England at all costs. After murdering Timothy Bigelow for being a traitor, former Son turned British Colonel, he chose to give up his role as minister. He drifted to Crawford County after his brother and took up the family trade of blacksmithy.
John Hale investigated the murder on behalf of the Crown, and grew suspicious of Strand. He and John Montresor went to Meadville to learn more. John Hale had blue eyes, flaxen blond hair, darker eyebrows, and stood slightly taller than average height (of the time), with mental powers of a sedate mind and pious. 
Fearful of being caught after being confronted by Montresor, David drifted closer to the wilderness in Charlotina Colony. The trail went cold, and Hale &amp; Montresor returned to New England.

            <Title>SchizoTech</Title>
            <Text>SchizoTech
The setting and timeline may seem at first to be The Middle Ages, The Colonial Period, or some Fantasy Counterpart Culture thereof, but when you look closer, you find polyester, robots, or other high-tech toys in between the horse-drawn wagons and wattle-and-daub buildings. There’s generally no rhyme or reason for which technologies are anachronistically present besides the Rule of Cool. Sometimes these may be leftovers from a lost technological civilization, or perhaps it could be that science developed along a different path than ours, allowing for more advanced technology in one field, while stagnating in others, but most of the time there is no explanation whatsoever for the bizarre mix of medieval and futuristic.
Schizo Tech is a key component of Punk Punk. It’s also the foundation for Fantasy Gun Control. Compare Decade Dissonance for when one side has all the cool toys. When a story nominally set in a real-life historical period has this problem, you’ve got yourself some tasty Anachronism Stew. It may be because an isolated branch of mankind created an Advanced Ancient Acropolis. After the End is normally a good justification of this; often resulting in Scavenger World, especially when you have a faction with Low Culture, High Tech.
When evaluating a candidate for this trope, try not to confuse anachronisms with non-western-isms. For example, a kimono can be just as modern as a three-piece suit, if not more so. Likewise, do not confuse anachronism for cosmetic purposes with anachronism of technological capability. For example, though you will see lots of Zeppelins from Another World at work in Schizo Tech, Airships themselves are not more or less advanced than airplanes or helicopters, just suited to different situations—namely, ones that value endurance, payload and fuel efficiency over speed and maneuverability. Alternatively, a judge wearing an eighteenth century robe and wig while judging cybercrime cases is not schizo tech, but simply a remnant of the Good Old Ways. And again, Tropes Are Still Not Bad. It’s also worth noting that in the alternate history of a candidate, the culture and style may simply be different, so while their older architecture may seem to jar with their higher levels of technology, it may be that that style of architecture is just “in” at that time. In dealing with other cultures, also remember that the concept of Technology Levels is flawed, and that real societies are not obliged to all invent the same things in the same order, and may miss some inventions entirely.
Most comic book universes have this trope as a natural consequence: the wondrous science held by the heroes and villains would, if even partially distributed, violate the surprisingly mundane world that divides the superhero genre from outright Speculative Fiction. Examples and subversions are noted below.
This trope has frequently been Truth in Television depending on the circumstances, with historical works involving World War I and other major events that were technological ‘kitchen sink’ like affairs (with cavalry charges co-existing with airplane bombing runs) one hundred percent qualifying. Beware: Many sci-fi settings that aren’t harder than diamond can become this constantly if you think about it too hard.
Compare Adventure-Friendly World, Anachronism Stew, Culture Chop Suey, and Fantasy Kitchen Sink. Technology Levels is what this trope averts. As well as Medieval European Fantasy, of course. If the old stuff proves as effective as the new stuff, you’ve also got an Archaic Weapon for an Advanced Age. It may also be the byproduct of a Retro Universe. Contrast Days of Future Past. Not to be confused with tech used by schizophrenics.</Text>

            <Text>Overview
Strand is a novella series broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 8–10 novellas as “chapters.” This follows the UK drama or Anime series season length. (See research)
Pattern. Seasons follow three intertwined storylines: combat, espionage/technology and diplomacy.
•	Combat - this storyline deals with the use of force.
•	Espionage - this storyline deals with exploration and theft of the ancient technology by various factions.
•	Diplomacy - this storyline addresses changes in sectarian and international politics.
Reading Length. A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel. (See Audience) Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but the storylines will either be incomplete or hinting at the future. 
Reading Analysis
•	Season
–	Each season comprises 10 novella-length episodes with a target episode length is 30,000±2,500 words, which is 90±7 pages.
–	Each season is 300,000±25,000 words, or about three 100,000 word novels; trilogy length.
–	Box sets comprise five books where each book is two episodes.
•	Episode
–	Each novella episode comprises 8 three-scene segments; 24 sections (~1250 words per section).
–	Each scene services a different storyline, with three storylines per episode.
–	Thus, each storyline comprises eight segments, which while integrated are otherwise standalone.
•	Reading Length
–	Reading pace: Average adult reading time is 220 wpm. https://www.irisreading.com/what-is-the-average-reading-speed/, https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/13/most-comprehensive-review-to-date-suggests-the-average-persons-reading-speed-is-slower-than-commonly-thought/
–	Therefore, each novella should take about 2 1/2 hours to read ± 10%
•	Listening Length
–	Listening pace: Audible standard voice pace is 150 wpm. https://findawayvoices.com/pricing/
–	A novella should complete in about 3 1/2 hours, which should be long enough to support one-leg if a flight.
–	A season should complete in about 33 hours, which should be enough to entertain a trucker for a week.
Season Pattern
The following is the season pattern, as well as the per-episode structure.
1.	Stasis - Everyday life, ends with inciting incident
2.	Trigger - Beyond control triggers the story
3.	Quest Fail 1-3
4.	Quest Fail 2
5.	Quest Fail 3
6.	Surprise - Something unexpected to reader and character ruins the quest.
7.	Critical Choice - Character makes a decision that reveals the character’s true nature
8.	Defeat / Climax - Critical choice leads to the darkest moment.
9.	Reversal - Character reverses behavior as a result
10.	Resolution - New stasis.
We plot the episodes in order: 10, 1, 6, 2-5, 9, 7, 8.
Episode Pattern
•	Trio Pattern. Each episode comprises three storylines where each storyline comprises eight segments.
–	Combat covers the tactical, human conflict (with blood as necessary).
–	Diplomacy engages the world changing political, social aspects of the divergence.
–	Stealth brings in the back-stabbing, conniving element, which is tied to either Combat or Diplomacy.
Audience
Readers of the Strand series are history buffs (especially American history), with varying religious, social and political beliefs; tending towards the left. They tend to be skeptical, educated and pro-science (even when religious). This describes the psychographics of a sample audience who self-identify as Alt-history fans on Wikipedia. They are tolerant and willing to consider other viewpoints. They are more likely to be veterans and patriotic. Strand leaders like the feel of history. They like accuracy, but they accept some inaccuracy when it favors a good story.
They are fans of mainstream science-fiction &amp; fantasy books, TV and movies. They are gamers, both computer and table-top. They are above-average intelligence. They enjoy reading. Popular TV series of Strand readers include: Turn (historical espionage), The Expanse (alien mystery and factious desire to dominate it), and Hell on Wheels (jealous factions collaborating toward a monumental goal, individuals with a dark past they are trying to live down).</Text>

            <Text>1783-1848: Eradication of African Slavery
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Discuss actual trends in African Slavery in Britain in this era.
Without the American Revolution, the anti-slavery movement in England starts earlier. Over this 50-year period (1772-1848), slavery was eliminated throughout the British Empire.
•	1772 - Somerset’s Case holds there is no basis for slavery in English law, and held that laws supporting slavery were against Natural Law. This extends to BNA.
•	1787 - Wilberforce’s Anti-Slavery Society struggled against London Society of West India Planters and Merchants who fought against abolition of slavery.
•	1807 - During a break in the French Troubles, England de-legalizes trans-shipment of slaves on the Oceans and between non-connected provinces.
•	1833 - “Apprenticeship Act of 1833” ends slavery in all British holdings by stages &amp; “apprenticeships.” Chattel is immediately repudiated by Parliament, meaning that African children were born free. Slave owners were mollified by a tax break for each freeborn child. Slave owners were compensated by tax. American high-society slave owners were well-compensated, lower-class owners were not, leading to some animosity. Increased investment in Toltec technology helps blunt the need for slaves during the Apprenticeship Period (1833-1846).
•	1846-48 - Apprenticeships ended in American provinces (Virginia, Carolina, Georgia) to increase representation in Parliament, leading to local civil conflicts in each province by the lower class “masters,” which was put down by General Scott.

### La Resistance

[♫ "One day to a new beginning Raise the flag of freedom high!" ♫](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LesMiserables)

[Wherever](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWorld) [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) is, you'll always find La Résistance: A [Ragtag Bunch of Misfits](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits) using [The Power of Love](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove) and [Friendship](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship) to fight against a tyrannical rule, often to help put the [Government in Exile](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile) back into power. Always underdogs, they fight using guerrilla warfare and by [raising the rabble](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabbleRouser) of the people by [revealing unpleasant truths](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheResistance) about [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) they've been trying to hide, causing the oppressed peoples to shake off the yokes of their tyrant rulers. Usually led by a [Rebel Leader](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader) and armed via [Vehicular Turnabout](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularTurnabout). Expect them to be opposed by [Les Collaborateurs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs).

Almost inevitably, [The Hero](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero) will join La Resistance while the battle is already underway, and will grow to become a great champion in the fight against [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire). After all, [Hollywood](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory) usually [romanticizes resistance fighters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeVillified), for three reasons. The first is rooted in America's origins as rebels fighting the English during [The American Revolution](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution). The second is likewise [World War II](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII) where the conflict between the Resistance and [Nazi Germany](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany) fell, as close as it ever has, to clear divisions between right and wrong, and of course, [Cool People Rebel Against Authority](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPeopleRebelAgainstAuthority). In most cases in history and in [Real Life](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife), resistance movements are complex and confusing events. A common mistake is to confuse resistance movements with revolutionary movements, when this is not always the case. Some resistance movements *are* revolutionary, seeking to install a new regime to displace the old. Revolutions, needless to say, are complex, murky and at times brutal affairs. It has led in the past to the new regime forming [the new government](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss) which [can be as bad or worse than the old.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution)

Of course, people rarely like having it pointed out that [these groups are terrorists from the perspective of anyone who disagrees with them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters) and [Innocent Bystanders](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander) who may get caught up in the crossfire of said conflicts. This may be deliberately ironic, perhaps inviting a "we are [Not So Different](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent)" moment. Or, [the author might simply assume that the audience will always sympathize with rebel protagonists](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality) against [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire), [therefore moral justification of the rebellion is unnecessary and the rebels can get away with whatever is expedient](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero). This could be averted if the [Evil Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) really is evil and the rebels exercise chivalry and restraint.

Alternatively, La Resistance will be utterly incompetent and little more than an annoyance until the hero gets in there and shows them how it's done. Sometimes [their inner dissensions render them nearly unable to get anything done.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether) Expect at least one member of La Resistance to be [The Mole](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole), or a homegrown [Les Collaborateurs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs) sabotaging their efforts from the inside. La Resistance may even be defeated without the assistance of its enemy: when the only thing uniting it is opposition to [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire), they may end up clashing thanks to some point of ideology (generally portrayed as stupid) or method (generally portrayed as worthwhile).

Also alternatively, La Resistance may represent the [last remnants](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant) of the reactionary or counter-revolutionary cronies of the old regime fighting against the Revolutionary Progressive Forces. Once re-installed, the Resistance "heroes" decide to [Retcon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon) the revolution and institute [purges](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge) for the cause of revenge, and remind people why exactly they were toppled in the first place. In some cases, as it happened in some parts of [World War II](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII), the Resistance contains factions who want to restore the old regime and factions which want to bring a new regime, and these two factions might struggle during and after the war.

When La Resistance form the main ensemble of the show, or one of them, they'll frequently exhibit a mix of characters similar to [The Squad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad). However, they'll usually have [sneakier methods](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpySpeak), they tend to be more morally pragmatic and ruthless than most [Squads](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad), and in series like *[Battlestar Galactica](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003)* members becoming [Shell Shocked Veterans](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran).

Sometimes La Resistance can be [downright nasty](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeCivilized). Usually, though, even at its worst La Resistance will be the [Lesser of Two Evils](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesserOfTwoEvils). If not, [Grey-and-Gray Morality](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality) may be at play. In an interesting twist, if the resistance [is every bit as unscrupulous as](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil) [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire), then the hero will end up doing a bit of [Conspiracy Redemption](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyRedemption) or [forming a third faction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption). *Very* occasionally, La Resistance may even be the [Big Bad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad) rebelling against a peaceful government. Occasionally, La Resistance will be shown in a more [comedic light, where they don't do much besides sitting around debating theory](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolutionariesWhoDontDoAnything).

Eventually, La Resistance will either die out, or grow into [The Alliance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance) as it gains power, allies, and sympathizers.

For the villainous equivalent, see [The Remnant](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant).

            <Text>Rights of Religious Liberty Act of 1772
British North America sought religious liberty. Parliament sought its debts to be paid and taxation for its recurring budget. Some of this budget paid Anglican ministerial salaries. This act permitted provinces to manage their own religious affairs. This effectively abolishes the Anglican church in British North America except for Virginia and Carolina. Thus liberty was a province matter, instead of individual. The lack of Anglican minsters removes British North America’s obligation to pay that portion of the budget. British North America provinces are allowed to establish their own state religions. Virginia and Carolina remained Anglican. Canada was not allowed to have Catholics in government, but was otherwise Catholic territory. New England became officially Congregationalist (Puritan). Though the power of puritanism lapsed a generation before, there is still enough friction between the denominations. Pennsylvania extended its religious tolerance through New York, making it a bastion for downtrodden faiths.</Text>

Fort Loudoun (2)
Fort Loudoun (2) (1756-1760) - A British Colonial French &amp; Indian War fort established in 1756 near present-day Vonore, Monroe County, Tennessee. Named for John Campbell, fourth Earl of Loudoun. Besieged by hostile Indians in 1760, surrendered to and burned down by them seven months later. Also spelled as Fort Loudon.

History

Established in 1756 by General Andrew Lewis, chief engineer of the British troops as the first structure built in present-day Tennessee. Built at the request of the Overhill Indians for protection from the French during the French &amp; Indian War. The site of the Cherokee town of Tuskegee lay in the valley south of the fort now covered by Tellico Lake.
Fort Loudoun was built as a large diamond-shaped defense, palisaded with a platformed bastion at each of the four angles and a raveline at the entrance. It was surrounded by a dry moat filled with young honey locust trees that produced four-inch thorns and acted like today's barbed wire. Chevaux de Frise was employed to cover the entrances and any other gaps in the locust tree hedge.

Within the fort was the commanding officer's house, barracks for the troops, a stone magazine, the officer of the day/guardhouse buildings, a commissary building, and other support buildings. The Sally Port was located at the north side while the main gate was located on the south facing the Indian village. Each of the bastions was platformed with embrasures for two cannons and each was named. The northwest bastion was the King's Bastion, the southwest was the Duke of Cumberland Bastion, the southeast was the Queen's Bastion and the northeast was the Prince of Wales Bastion. The flag was located in the Prince of Wales bastion, the high point in the post. The interior of the post was on a rather steep slope down from the north side to the south and, at that time, the post was on a bluff overlooking the Cherokee village.
Anglo-Cherokee War

After the murder of several Cherokee chiefs, the Cherokee became hostile and they laid siege to the fort in February 1760. After seven months the garrison was forced to surrender with a promise of safe passage to Fort Prince George (3). The Indians reneged, killing some of the survivors and taking the remainder hostage. The hostages were later ransomed and delivered to Fort Prince George (1). The fort was burned to the ground by the Indians and was not rebuilt.
The fort site was rediscovered and excavated in the 1930s. The WPA began restoration of parts of the fort in 1937 and the restoration was completed in the 1960s. The replica is built over the original site but, because dams along the Little Tennessee River raised the river level, the replica fort is some 17 feet above the level of the original fort.

Current Status

Must See! Fort Loudoun State Historical Park, Vonore, Monroe County, Tennessee. Reproduction of the fort and several markers. Zoom out to see the marker map points and the Visitor Center/Museum location.
The site includes a small visitor center/museum with displays and models for both Fort Loudoun and the Tellico Blockhouse across the water. Most of the fort buildings are fitted out with period correct furnishings and present a view into life at the fort. Some nine times a year reenactors are present over a weekend to provide a better view of the life, dress, and occupations of the fort occupants. The southwest bastion contains two display cannons, one of which is fired periodically when the reenactors are present. A large British colonial flag is flown over the fort.

The colonies of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia were consolidated into the Province of Virginia, creating religious friction between Anglicans and Catholics. The boundary with Pennsylvania was finalized by the Mason Dixon survey; consistent with the Original Timeline. The boundary with Carolina was likewise finalized along the 36°30' parallel; consistent with the Original Timeline. The Western border with Mississippi and Charlotina by the Atlantic &amp; Mississippi Watersheds described by the Appalachian Divide. Virginia encompasses all parts of West Virginia and Virginia that flow into the Atlantic. Mississippi and Charlotina encompass those parts of West Virginia and Virginia that flow into the Mississippi.

Organizations
Government of British America
In 1754, Benjamin Franklin proposed what became known as the Albany Plan Wikipedia. Albany Plan. Accessed April 4, 2020. See also, Yale. Albany Plan of Union. Accessed April 4, 2020.. This plan proposed a Grand Council which essentially gave British North America home rule. While the plan was rejected, it was the basis of the negotiated reconciliation between British North America and Britain. These privileges were not extended to the British West Indies, leading to some friction with the Indies that was mitigated by the Indies planters establishing residences in Carolina.[^OTL-Albany Plan]
[^OTL-Albany Plan]: OTL: Benjamin Franklin proposed the plan at the Albany Congress at the age of 46. The plan was rejected both by the colonies and Parliament. Elements of this Plan recurred during the Continental Congress.
The Council of British North America represented the split interests of the former colonies, Crown and Parliament. It was bicameral, with the House of Representatives comprising provincial delegates appointed by the provincial assemblies. As with the Albany Plan, each province was given between two and seven seats based upon the proportional amount of revenue they provided to the Commonwealth. House of Ministers represented a smaller body of ministers appointed by Parliament to consult on legislation from the House of Representatives, with one minister appointed per province. The Council (also known as the Grand Council) managed local affairs between the provinces and local Indian tribes. Parliament retained right of refusal provided they acted within three years of the legislation.
Internal provincial legislation is managed via Provincial Assemblies. Each Assembly was bicameral, with the House of Lords appointing the Council of State and province landowners electing members of the Council of Commons. The Crown appoints a Lieutenant Governor as executive to each Province, as well as the Governor of British America. Each provincial government appoints 9 seats to the British Parliament, for a total of 54 seats in the Commons. Compare this with the 45 seats given to Scotland in 1707.
The result of this governmental structure is that the legislatures are dominated by local oligarchies. These oligarchs jealously defend their power, thus quieting the American Troubles, and largely followed the Lords’ suggestions.
The British America Act of 1771 restructured British America (the continent) into six provinces: Canada, New England, Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York), Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia. This led to six Provincial Assemblies. This led to a significant amount of internal tension within all but Georgia.
Mississippi Land Company
The Mississippi Land Company formed in 1763 following the British victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763) in North America. The company sought to acquire land grants in the vast former New France region between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River ceded by France to Britain after the war.
The Mississippi Land Company was formed by colonial Virginians including George Washington, John Augustine Washington, Richard Henry Lee, Arthur Lee, and William Fitzhugh. The company hoped to establish a new colony in the Mississippi Valley by petitioning the Crown for 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²) in what became Charlotina and parts of northern Mississippi. OTL: Their timing was poor, because the British government soon issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which put a temporary halt to the western expansion of the British colonies. Although the boundary line established by the proclamation was extended westward in the following years, the Mississippi Company was never granted lands, and ceased to operate by about 1770.
Odyssey Limited
This is the limited charter company established by the British Crown for Slipstream exploration.
Sons of Liberty
The Sons of Liberty was a secret organization that was created in the Thirteen American Colonies to advance the rights of the European colonists and to fight taxation by the British government. It played a major role in most colonies in battling the Stamp Act in 1765.
During the Point of Divergence, calmer heads prevailed, leading to successful redress of the Sons of Liberty grievances. A splinter group remained, led by Sam Adams &amp; John Brown. As part of the settlement, the violent Sons were identified by the Sons’ leadership.
During the Discovery season, the Sons are actively hunted by a British organization led by Ephraim Lapham and John Tremain.
Those rebels who were arrested were put on trial, and most were found guilty of insurrection against the Crown—100 in total were convicted. They were punished either by death (if a leader) or transportation to Australia, which had replaced British America as a penal colony after the Reform in America Act of 1771. Public hanging took place in the Parliament House Square (seat of Parliament of North America, formerly the Pennsylvania State House, Independence Hall IRL).

Society for Alien/American/Advanced Research (SAR)
Overview. Originally called the Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research Efforts (ST3R), the Society for Alien Research (SAR) is a limited crown company charged with deciphering Toltec technology into viable capabilities that keeps Britain globally dominant.
Naming Confusion. The original name owes to a misunderstanding of archeology, which was subsequently renamed in various times as either the Society for Alien (or) American (or) Advanced Research.
The Babylonian Captivity. ST3R operated on the grounds of Franklin’s Public Academy of Philadelphia. Its move from Philadelphia to Yale under Kneass’ directorship, a period known as the Babylonian Captivity by College of Philadelphia members. It returned to Philadelphia after Kneass’ death in 1840 and remained since.

### SchizoTech

The setting and timeline may seem at first to be [The Middle Ages](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges), [The Colonial Period](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirteenAmericanColonies), or some [Fantasy Counterpart Culture](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture) thereof, but when you look closer, you find polyester, robots, or other high-tech toys in between the horse-drawn wagons and wattle-and-daub buildings. There's generally no rhyme or reason for *which* technologies are anachronistically present besides the [Rule of Cool](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool). Sometimes these may be leftovers from a [lost technological civilization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology), or perhaps it could be that science developed along a different path than ours, allowing for more advanced technology in one field, while stagnating in others, but most of the time there is no explanation whatsoever for the bizarre mix of medieval and futuristic.

Schizo Tech is a key component of [Punk Punk](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkPunk). It's also the foundation for [Fantasy Gun Control](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl). Compare [Decade Dissonance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadeDissonance) for when one side has all the cool toys. When a story nominally set in a real-life historical period has this problem, you've got yourself some tasty [Anachronism Stew](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew). It may be because an [isolated branch of mankind](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies) created an [Advanced Ancient Acropolis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientAcropolis). [After the End](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd) is normally a good justification of this; often resulting in [Scavenger World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld), especially when you have a faction with [Low Culture, High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech).

When evaluating a candidate for this trope, try not to confuse anachronisms with non-western-isms. For example, a kimono can be just as modern as a three-piece suit, if not more so. Likewise, do not confuse anachronism for cosmetic purposes with anachronism of technological capability. For example, though you will see lots of [Zeppelins from Another World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld) at work in Schizo Tech, [Airships](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Airships) themselves are not more or less advanced than airplanes or helicopters, just suited to different situations—namely, ones that value endurance, payload and fuel efficiency over speed and maneuverability. Alternatively, a judge wearing an eighteenth century robe and wig while judging cybercrime cases is not schizo tech, but simply a remnant of the [Good Old Ways](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays). And again, [Tropes Are Still Not Bad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools). It's also worth noting that in the alternate history of a candidate, the culture and style may simply be different, so while their older architecture may seem to jar with their higher levels of technology, it may be that that style of architecture is just "in" at that time. In dealing with other cultures, also remember that the concept of [Technology Levels](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels) is flawed, and that [real societies are not obliged to all invent the same things in the same order, and may miss some inventions entirely.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel)

Most comic book universes have this trope as a natural consequence: the wondrous science held by the [heroes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRIchardsIsUseless) and [villains](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck) would, if even partially distributed, violate the surprisingly mundane world that divides the superhero genre from outright [Speculative Fiction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction). Examples and subversions are noted below.

This trope has frequently been [Truth in Television](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision) depending on the circumstances, with historical works involving [World War I](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI) and other major events that were technological 'kitchen sink' like affairs (with cavalry charges co-existing with airplane bombing runs) one hundred percent qualifying. Beware: Many sci-fi settings that aren't [harder than diamond](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfSciFiHardness) can become this *constantly* if you think about it too hard.

Compare [Adventure-Friendly World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureFriendlyWorld), [Anachronism Stew](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew), [Culture Chop Suey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey), and [Fantasy Kitchen Sink](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink). [Technology Levels](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels) is what this trope averts. As well as [Medieval European Fantasy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy), of course. If the old stuff proves as effective as the new stuff, you've also got an [Archaic Weapon for an Advanced Age](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchaicWeaponForAnAdvancedAge). It may also be the byproduct of a [Retro Universe](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroUniverse). Contrast [Days of Future Past](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast). [Not to be confused with](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant) tech used by schizophrenics.

            <Synopsis>Ephriam goes to another town and gets hired as a smith who comments on his breeding, hands, and disrespect for civil authority. "I'm not fond of the color red."</Synopsis>
            <Text>Friday, September 17, 1762. Before dawn, he set off for Falling Springs. It would be a long walk---about ten miles---and a less awkward farewell. He helped himself to some cold chicken, and some shillings paper his brother absentmindely left on the table the night before. His brother did not ask where he was going, so he did not tell him. All the better. Ephraim thought. The fewer who knew the better.
He passed a few travelers on the road. Most were travelers. All were armed. With each mile, Ephraim felt more conspicuous wearing attire more suited for Philadelphia than the wilderness. Not a few of the travelers eyed him with suspicion or derision.
Not long before noon, he arrived in Falling Springs. As he had heard, there were more buildings than needed for the inhabitants. A good place to start over.
He made his way straight for the smith. He found it near Conococheague Creek, not far from Chamber’s fort. It was odd to him that the log fort in Shippensburg filled him with more dread than Chamber’s. Falling Springs oddly mirrored Shippensburg with its wooden houses and stone fort. It was as if Judge Shippen expected his settlement to withstand the test of time, and Chambers did not. Or, it could be because Shippen started earlier. Ephraim thought the war brought a lot into question.
The smith pumped the bellows as Ephraim entered. The smith’s back was to the entrance, and he focused intently on his work. Ephraim set his bag down and watched quietly for a few moments. He remembered working the bellows for his dad when he was a boy. A journey towards being a blacksmith diverted to divinity by fortune. The smith was perhaps a dozen years older than Ephraim, or a bit less than that.
After a few minutes, the smith turned. He looked less surprised than he was tired. “Are you going to just stand there? What do you want?” The Scotch-Irish brogue was intelligible enough.
Ephraim hesitated at the abruptness. “I did not want to distract you from your work.”
“You have. What will it be?”
Straight to the point. “I’m looking for a job. I’ve worked in a smithy before. You seem a little short handed.”
The smith shook his head. “Maybe a few years ago. It’s the damned war. Most the townsfolk have moved back to Philadelphia, or been killed.”
None of this surprised Ephraim. The war lasted nearly half his life. Bradford’s Pennsylvania Journal reported on the atrocities. It was a fact of life. “True. But, it’s gotten quieter over the past couple of years. With the Navy beating the French and Spanish in the Indies, it will be over soon.”
“Prophet, are ye? It may have quieted between the English and French, but not for us and the Indians.” The smith forgot the bellows. “Just the other day, we hear word that Jim Walker just escaped the savages. He made the mistake of straying too far from Fort Loudon when the bastards shot his horse and mounted it saddle on him. Had he not the knife on him, he’d have been a goner. Heard that, did ye?”
Ephraim shook his head.
“Aye. They got him back to the Indian settlement when he was left with two of them. He fetches his knife when they were both asleep.” The smith pantomimed cutting tied wrists. “Just like that, he’s free. One of the bastards woke and they scuffled. He grabs the savage by the hair and plunged the knife into his throat.” The smith enjoyed acting out the fight. “He said the other fellow woke when he heard his friend killed, but was so scared that he ran off. Mr. Walker only two weeks ago emerged from the wilderness back to Fort Loudon. So, I don’t think the settlers will be back as soon as you think.”
“Where’s Fort Loudon?”
The smith motions over Ephraim’s shoulder. “Off that way about a day’s ride.”
Ephraim concluded “that way” was further to the West. “When were they last here?”
“A few years. We haven’t but one in ten that we had here when the war started. Ben plans to lay out a proper town at some point. Maybe then---“
“Then you need help.”
The smith sighed. “When there’s a town, yes. But that won’t be for years.”
“I need the work. Not for wages. Just to get on my feet and head down the road.”
“To Fort Pitt?”
“No, down to Virginia, perhaps.”
“Aye, perhaps. What’s in Virginia?”
“My business.”
“You got a name?”

Ephraim hesitated. The last thing he wanted was his name to attract attention. “Jeffry.”
“Jeffry what?”
“Boydell.” It came out of his mouth before he could think. Now he had to commit to it. “Jeffry Boydell.”
“You’re a dandy, Mister Boydell. I mean, look at you. Nobody dresses like that out here.”
Ephraim looked down at his suit. It fit Philadelphia fashion with its skin tight breeches buckled at the knee. He had loosened the fitted blue waistcoat during the walk from Shippensburg, but the neckerchief hid that. The gold embroidery and buttons did stand out. The Smith’s breeches were similar, albeit black, with a looser fitting brown waistcoat. None of the ruffles, embroidery or non-functional buttons.
“No way you’re working in that. You’ve not worked a rough day in your life.”
“My father was a smith, I’ll have you know.” He made a point of changing his accent a bit. He tried to sound rougher. “I ‘prentised under him. I can work the bellows. I can do most of the work you would expect if you had a ‘prentise. You’re doing work you oughtn’t do if you’re the master smith. I can’t do much about the suit. But, you can’t judge a book by its cover.”
“Humph.” The smith considered Ephraim for a few moments. “Go on. Let me see your hands.”
Ephraim held his hands out.
The smith grabbed the hand, and turned it palm up and back to palm down. “Not a dandy’s hands. I’ll give you that. Not quite rough, but not dainty. They’ve seen some work.”
“As I said, I ‘prentised under my father. He wanted something better of me and my brother. Don’t let my attire deceive you. I can do just about everything you need.”
“Everything, eh? We’ll see about that. It would do to have a lighter load. I’ll try you on and see if this works out, Mister Boydell. But, if you’ve not proved your metal by week’s end, away with ya.”
Ephraim noted the bite in the smith’s warning. He thought back to the hot, sweaty days as a young boy. It just occurred to him that he may not be in the best shape to swing a hammer. He had to try. “There’s something more?”
“Aye?”
“I’ll need some place to stay.” He lifted his bag. “All that I have is here.”
“Och. There it is. Did you think that didn’t occur to me, lad? Here I thought you’ve lived here in Falling Springs me whole life and I just now laid eyes on you. You’re a daft one that.” He motioned toward a ladder at the back of the shop, then pointed up. “There’s the loft, for services rendered. But, until then, get this fire going again. I’m going for a piss.”</Text>

Our Timeline. In our timeline, The Toltec culture is an ancient culture that dominated a state centered in Mexico in the early post-classic period of Mesoamerican chronology. Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park, is an archaeological site from the Late Woodland period in Arkansas that protects an 18-mound complex with the tallest surviving prehistoric mounds in Arkansas. The identification of the site with the Toltec of Mexico was a 19th-century mistake. Mrs. Gilbert Knapp, owner of the land from 1857 to 1900, thought the Toltecs had built the mounds.
Strand Timeline. The Toltec Mounds are found throughout the Mississippi river valley (the Ohio Hopewell region). These are likewise confused with the Toltecs by an Englishman who fancied himself an adept at native cultures. He persuaded enough people that he was right until the name stuck until the period of Babylonian Captivity (1826-40). There is no relationship between the Toltecs and the advanced technology discovered at the Toltec Mound.

            <Text>Decade Dissonance
A large-scale form of Schizo Tech.
Every country is different thanks to culture and geography, and no two cities in any one country are alike either. However some worlds can take this to extremes, making two side by side cities as different as night and day. The differences can be purely cosmetic or go all the way to lifestyle, architecture, and even technology. You can have a Utopia city made of Crystal Spires and Togas sitting smack dab next to a ghetto…sorry, “quaint hamlet” that never left The Middle Ages.
The reason, if any is given, is that there’s no technology trade between the countries, so any discoveries a country makes (from Agriculture to Zoology) never leave it. Other times it’s a question of societal values, where the “savage” village has chosen not to develop technology in favor of peaceful agrarian lives; however you can expect them to have copious and advanced magic if it’s a Magic Versus Science setting. It’s almost never purely stylistic, like Gotham City and Metropolis. Both exist in the same year and country, but one is firmly entrenched in 1920’s Gothic and Noir style, while the other is an Art Deco optimistic future.
More plausible is Used Future, where one area is able to maintain a relative level of sophistication After or Just Before the End where others are reduced to tent villages. In these cases, advanced technology is known of by most, but becomes uncommon away from the advanced areas.

PREFACE.

Washington's Journal here given to the public, if we except his version of the "Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation," is the earliest literary effort of this, the most admirable character in all history. The editor has long been engaged in collecting accurate copies of all the obtainable writings of this great man. Wherever it has been found practicable to examine and critically compare even his generally accepted writings with the originals, it has been, or will be done to secure a copy of exact and verified conformity, in every particular, with the text as it left the hand of the writer.
It is a well-known fact that editors have taken great liberties with Washington's writings, not for the purpose of falsifying history, or aspersing his character, but from a variety of reasons, often to suppress caustic expressions, or to substitute a more euphonious word to give to his sentences a fine, rhetorical finish. Such editorial dressing, even where the motive is well intended, is vicious in principle and liable to abuse; and, in the case of Washington's writings, is neither justifiable nor desirable. The time has come when the people want to know intimately and without glamour or false coloring, the father of his country as he actually lived and labored,
[6]
and to possess his writings, just as he left them, on every subject which engaged his attention. It is the purpose of the editor to prepare a complete collection of all the writings of George Washington, from his youth to the close of his eventful life, with that literal exactness as to text which can only be assured by the careful efforts of an experienced copyist and expert proof reader having access to and comparing in every possible case the copies with the originals. This initial Diary of Washington opens with his sixteenth year, and plainly shows the energy and the maturity of his judgment, and his capability to discharge even then important trusts with efficiency.
Forthcoming volumes will give, in chronological order, his co-operation in the march of events on this continent, and his life and opinions as seen through the writings he left. This volume must be viewed as the work of a youth, making a few, brief and hurried memoranda while in the depths of the forest and intended for no eye but his own. The time is not far distant when an edition of Washington's more important papers will be called for in facsimile by some one of the photogravure processes now available for such purposes, because of the unquestionable fidelity to the original it secures and which is approximately arrived at in this publication.
This is the first systematic attempt to produce the writings of Washington with literal exactness as to abbreviations, the use of capitals, punctuation, spelling, etc. It is possible that the plan pursued may
[7]
not, at first, meet with an unqualified commendation from the public. But if the editor does not much mistake the desire of students, the admirers of Washington and the demand of historians, this method, if faithfully executed, must produce the preferred edition of his writings.
A few miscellaneous pieces in Washington's youthful handwriting are preserved in this Journal, and are here printed with the same effort for literal accuracy which has been bestowed upon the Journal itself, and upon his field notes of land surveys.

INTRODUCTION.

This journal of George Washington, now for the first time printed entire and with literal exactness, was begun, as shown by the date in the opening lines, when he was but one month over sixteen years of age. It is his own daily record of observations during his first remunerated employment. His proficiency as a surveyor, and his fortitude in encountering the hardships of the forest in this expedition were, considering his age, truly remarkable. With him the beginning determined the end. Biographers have made us acquainted with the character of his worthy parents, and with the sturdy stock from which they were descended. It does seem as though Providence called our Washington into being, and educated him in the western world just at the time when a great leader was wanted to direct a revolution, and to found on this continent a new and a free, English-speaking nation. Every factor, whether of lineage or culture, in the admirably balanced character of Washington, as well as every aspiration of his heart, from his cradle to his grave, is of high interest to the world. Although deprived of a father's care at the age of
[10]
eleven years, he was, however, especially blessed in having such a mother as the noble Mary Washington, who conscientiously discharged her sacred duty as his guardian, counselor and friend. Hence filial reverence grew with his growth and strengthened with his maturing years into fixed principles, making him throughout all his eventful life loyal to every virtue and heroic in every trust.
When George Washington set out on the enterprise herein narrated, he was just out of school, where he had received the best education the neighborhood could supply, supplemented with good private instruction. We may well believe that his mother and his brothers then supposed that George had attained an age and proficiency when he should either go to college to acquire a higher education, or embark speedily in some respectable calling; and we may further conclude that this precocious youth was eager to take part in the affairs of life, and deferentially announced his preference for the latter course. Possibly he was influenced in this selection by his great admiration for his half-brother, Major Lawrence Washington, who was actively and prosperously engaged in various business enterprises, who made much of George, and had him visit Mount Vernon whenever it was practicable.
George Washington's aptitude for mathematics early attracted the attention of his teachers, and his beautifully kept copy-books, which are still preserved, attest his unusual ability in mathematical demonstra
[11]
tion and diagrams. Mr. Williams, the principal of the Academy in Westmoreland county, Va., where young Washington was, to give a practical value to this mathematical talent, had added surveying and navigation to his other studies; and these were soon mastered by this bright pupil. Land surveying was then a profitable and genteel pursuit in the colonies, and it comported well with Washington's tastes and inclinations. While visiting his brother at Mount Vernon, he had repeatedly amused himself and entertained guests of the house by surveying, in their presence, the garden, or a field, and rapidly drawing plats of them as an exercise. A few maps of such early surveys have been preserved. One of them, of Lawrence Washington's turnip field, bearing date 27 Feb., 1747-8, is reproduced in fac-simile in this publication. The others are without date, but are of about the same period; although one, namely that of "Hell Hole," a part of the Mount Vernon estate, and frequently mentioned in Washington's later diaries, may have been an earlier production. A fac-simile of it may also be found in this work.
Washington's efficiency and enthusiasm as a surveyor were observed and admired not only by his friend and companion, George William Fairfax, but also by the Hon. Wm. Fairfax and by Lord Fairfax, who were constantly employing surveyors to lay off lands for sale in the latter's large domain known as "The Northern Neck" of Virginia. During the early spring of 1748 the demands for surveys were
[12]
more than usually pressing by actual settlers in the Shenandoah valley. Lord Fairfax engaged the youth, George Washington, to proceed with George William Fairfax, his agent, as recorded in this journal, to execute certain commissions and meet a pressing demand. His surveys and reports gave entire satisfaction and led to his steady employment by his titled patron, principally as a director of his lordship's land office and of the surveys, preparatory to sale. Washington filled this position for about three years, when he was called upon to accompany his brother Lawrence, who, from failing health, was constrained, in the fall of 1751, to visit the West Indies in the hope of finding relief.
The journal kept by George Washington during his visit to Barbadoes in company with his brother, will be given in a separate work soon to be issued in its chronological order by the editor. The journal here presented to the public is, in the main, confined to Washington's daily entries, memoranda and field notes of surveys of land situated between the Blue Ridge and the Alleghany mountains.
Unfortunately the records of his surveys are not consecutive, and it is quite evident that they represent but a part, and probably but a small part, of the land surveyed by Washington for Lord Fairfax and others. The notes of surveys here published are all that can be found or that are now known to exist. It is to be hoped, however, that if other books of his field notes of surveys have escaped destruction, they may yet be
[13]
discovered. This hope is encouraged from the fact that the laws of the colony required surveyors, upon retiring from their official stations as county surveyors, to deposit their field books of notes of surveys with the records of the county. How far this law was complied with, the editor is unable to say. It is a mistake, however, to infer that Washington was constantly employed in actually running lines and taking field notes. He was largely charged with the supervision of Lord Fairfax's land office, and the records thereto belonging, and was his principal adviser in his land surveys, directing the men employed in the field work.
This journal, with its memoranda and surveys, makes a valuable addition to our knowledge of the life and employments of Washington in his youth. Here are also preserved the names of nearly three hundred of the early settlers and first land owners in the great valley of Virginia, for whom Washington made surveys, or who assisted him in this business.
It was a cherished hope of the editor that he might be able to give, in notes, brief sketches of the pioneers in the valley here named, through the assistance of their descendants, who, in many instances, reside upon lands surveyed by Washington for their ancestors. In this, however, he has been disappointed.
The journal, memoranda and surveys found in these books have all been copied with literal exactness and are here printed just as they were recorded by the hand of their author. This literalness is ad
[14]
hered to in the interest of truth and for the benefit of earnest students of history unable to consult personally the originals. Washington requires no apology for any apparent want of style or other marks of hasty composition in this journal. It was written in the nature of a memorandum intended for himself alone. His thoughts, even in these youthful productions, flow easily and in an orderly and consecutive manner. His sentences are never involved or obscure, and his observations are always apt and instructive; and, although a youth in years when this journal was written, he was dealing ably with important interests, and deporting himself in a manly manner, and associating on terms of intimacy with the foremost men of the day. He seems to have had no idle boy life, but was a man with manly instincts and ambitions from his youth. Time and accidents are slowly, but effectually, destroying the precious original manuscripts, so that a literal and authentic copy is a great desideratum. No liberty whatever is taken by the editor with the text as recorded by Washington. The notes which are added, it is hoped, may prove of interest.

JOURNAL.

A Journal of my Journey over the Mountains began Fryday the 11th of March 1747-8.[1]
Fryday March 11th 1747-8. Began my Journey[2] in Company with George Fairfax, Esqr.;[3] we travell'd this day 40 Miles to Mr George Neavels[4] in Prince William County.[5]
[1]
Double dating of the year, as is done here, was an old custom observed between January 1st and the 25th of March. For all other portions of the year a single date was used. Although January 1st had been generally accepted as the beginning of the historical year in Christian countries, yet March 25th was held by some as the beginning of the civil or legal year. The Gregorian chronology or new style had not, at the time this journal was written, been adopted by England, and, indeed, was not until September 2nd, 1752.

The party on this expedition set out from "Belvoir," the home and plantation of the Hon. William Fairfax, described by General Washington as "within full view of Mount Vernon, separated by water only, is one of the most beautiful seats on the river." (Letter to John Sinclair, 11 December, 1796.) It was founded by William Fairfax, cousin and agent to Lord Thomas Fairfax, and was his residence until his death in 1757. The estate then passed to his eldest son, George William Fairfax, also one of Lord Fairfax's agents, and was his residence until July, 1773, when, accompanied by his wife, he went to England to attend to some property he had inherited there. Washington, his friend and neighbor, consented to act as his agent during his absence, which, at the time, neither anticipated would be of long continuance. 
[16]
"Law's delay" and business interests making it important for Mr. Fairfax to remain in England, he directed Washington to dispose of his stock, farm fixtures and household effects at public sale. After due advertisement, this was done August 15, 1774. A second sale at "Belvoir" took place December 5, 1774. 
The following bill of household effects bought at this first sale at Belvoir by George Washington has been preserved among his private papers and was in the possession of one of his inheritors, Lawrence Washington, in January 1891. The bill in the auctioneer's handwriting was folded and endorsed in Washington's known hand:—"Articles bought by Go Washington at Colo Fairfax's Sale 15 August 1774."

The following admirable description of the estate is taken from an advertisement in the Pennsylvania Gazette of Philadelphia, October 19, 1774: 
"To be rented from year to year, or for a term of years,—Belvoir, the beautiful seat of the Honorable Geo. W. Fairfax, Esq., upon the Potomac river, in Fairfax county, about 14 miles below Alexandria. 
"The mansion is of brick, two stories high, with four convenient rooms, and a large passage on the lower floor; five rooms and a large passage on the second; servants' hall and cellar below; convenient to it are offices, stables and coach-house; adjacent is a large and well furnished garden stored with a great variety of fruits, all in good order. 
"Appertaining to the tract on which these houses stand and which contains near 2,000 acres (surrounded in a manner by navigable water), are several valuable fisheries and a good deal of clear land in different parts which may be let all together or separately as shall be found most convenient. 
[18]
"The terms may be known of Colonel Washington who lives near the premises, or of me in Berkeley county. 
"Francis Willis, Junior." 
The estate was leased to the Rev. Andrew Morton for a term of seven years. Unfortunately the mansion was destroyed by fire only a few years later. The owner's long absence, and the fact that there was no house to invite a careful tenant, together with the excitement and derangement of business incident to the war for independence, caused the estate rapidly to depreciate in value. Early in 1775 Washington relinquished the agency of George W. Fairfax's business in America, as his time was fully taken up in directing the momentous affairs of the Revolution.
[3]
George William Fairfax, eldest son of the Hon. William Fairfax, of "Belvoir," Va., was born in Nassau, New Providence, West Indies, in 1724. His father having been appointed to the custom house in Salem, Massachusetts, he was taken to that town and resided there until 1734, about which time his father accepted the agency of Lord Fairfax's lands in Virginia, and removed to that province. For a time he resided in Westmoreland county, Va., but after a couple of years he settled upon and developed the "Belvoir" estate on the Potomac river. George William Fairfax was educated in England, and coming to his majority settled at "Belvoir," and married Sarah, daughter of Col. Wilson Cary, of Hampton, Va., who some writers, on rather apocryphal testimony, endeavor to show was an object of Washington's ardent devotion when a mere youth. The same compliment has also been claimed for her sister Mary, who married Edward Ambler, and for other belles of that period in Virginia, as well as in some of the other colonies. George W. Fairfax, after his marriage, resided part of the time at "Belvoir," and part at "Greenway Court," as agent of Lord Fairfax, in the vicinity of which he owned and cultivated lands. On his father's death in 1757 he inherited "Belvoir," where he continued to reside until the summer of 1773, when, accompanied by his wife, he went to England to look after some property he had inherited there. The proprietors of "Belvoir" and "Mount Vernon" and their families were always on the most friendly terms, as the letters extant of each attest, and Washington's diaries fully confirm. Mr. Fairfax
[19]
favored the early protests by the colonies and petitions to the king in the interests of the colonies, but opposed measures looking to forcible resistance. Washington consented to act as his agent while he was absent, presuming his stay in England would be of short duration. But a complication of matters detained him abroad so that he instructed his agent to sell off his stock at "Belvoir" and lease the property. A sale was accordingly held on the estate in August, 1774, which continued two days. A second and further sale was held in December the same year. The property was leased in 1774 for seven years, but shortly after this the mansion house was burned down and never rebuilt. During the Revolutionary war some of Mr. Fairfax's property in Fairfax county was escheated to the state. His loss of income from America led him to limit his expense, he therefore removed from Yorkshire to Bath and lived in a modest way, dividing generously, from his limited means, with the American prisoners of war held in England. He had no children. A friendly correspondence was kept up between him and Washington to the close of his life. He was urged to return to America, but his mansion at "Belvoir" having been destroyed by fire he kept putting it off and never returned. He left "Belvoir" and some other landed property to Ferdinand, son of his half-brother, Rev. Bryan Fairfax, and died at Bath in England, April 3, 1787, and was buried in Wirthlington church. His will appointed George Washington as one of his executors. His wife survived him until 1812. Her remains were placed by the side of her husband's.
[4]
George Neville, Esq., was among the earliest planters to settle in the western part of Prince William county, Va. As early as, or before 1730, he selected a large body of desirable land lying on the main road by way of Ashby's Gap from Fredericksburg to Winchester. Here his residence was beautifully situated on high, healthy and productive land near the head springs of Bull Run, a tributary of the Occoquan river, and 34 miles from Fredericksburg, the head of tide water on the Rappahannock river. Squire Neville, the proprietor of this fine estate, as he was usually called, was a man of steady and industrious habits, possessed a fine constitution, gentle in his manners, and cultured in his tastes, enterprising and thrifty, with a genius for overcoming such difficulties as always beset
[20]
the path of the pioneer in a new country. As the lands to the west of him, and particularly those in the Shenandoah valley beyond the Blue Ridge, began to attract settlers the travel on the road past his house became considerable, and as a matter of accommodation to the public he opened an ordinary and kept a store for general merchandizing. Neville's Ordinary was a land mark, and is to be found on Fry and Jefferson's Map of Virginia, as well as on Governor Pownall's and other early maps of Virginia. In 1750 Washington surveyed for Mr. Neville 400 acres of land. By marriage George Neville was related to the Fairfax family of Virginia. His wife, Ann Burroughs, was a cousin to Lord Thomas Fairfax of "Greenway Court," the proprietor of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Squire Neville and his wife were blessed with a numerous family of healthy sons and daughters, who inherited the sturdy virtues of their parents, and who founded families for themselves, and whose descendants are to be found throughout the southern and western states. Joseph Neville, son of George, was a prosperous planter in the western part of Prince William county, Va., in 1760. (See Washington's Diary.) He served as a colonel in the Revolution, was one of the commissioners for running the boundary line between Pennsylvania and Virginia, and was a member of Congress 1793-5; died in Hardy county, Va., 1819. John Neville, another son, was colonel of the 4th Virginia regiment in the Revolution, and brigadier-general in the Pennsylvania militia at the close of the war. He was born in Virginia 26 July, 1731. From his youth he had a fondness for military affairs and served in the Braddock expedition, and also in the Dunmore Indian war. He and his brothers were early and life-long friends of General Washington, the acquaintance beginning when they were youths. At an early date John Neville took up considerable tracts of land in Frederick and Augusta counties, Va. He resided for some years in the Shenandoah valley, being at one time sheriff of Frederick county. He also acquired large tracts of land on Chartier's creek in Pennsylvania, and had built himself a house preparatory to taking up his residence there, when the Revolutionary war began, in which he took an active and honorable part. This event postponed, for some years, his removal with his family to Pennsylvania. On the 24th August, 1754, he was united in marriage to Winifred Oldham, by whom he had two
[21]
children, a son and a daughter, Presley and Amelia. Presley Neville married Nancy, daughter of General Daniel Morgan, and they became the progenitors of the large and influential family of Nevilles of Pittsburg, Pa. Colonel Presley Neville, as he was called, served in the Revolution for three years on the staff of General Lafayette. Amelia Neville married Major Isaac Craig of the Revolution, and they became the founders of the well known and esteemed family of Craigs of Pittsburg.—Eagle's Pennsylvania Genealogies.
[5]
Prince William county, Va., formed in 1730 from Stafford and King George counties, embraced territory extending from the Potomac river on the east to the summit of the Blue Ridge on the west; it was divided from Loudoun county by the Occoquan and Bull Run streams. Prior to 1822 the county seat was at Dumfries, but at that date it was removed to Brentville.

Saturday March 12th this Morning Mr James Genn ye surveyor[6] came to us, we travel'd over ye Blue Ridge[7] to Capt Ashbys[8] on Shannondoah River,[9] Nothing remarkable happen'd.
[6]
James Genn, a licensed surveyor in Virginia, much employed by Lord Fairfax, and frequently mentioned by Washington, and whose name often appears signed to surveys in which the latter was engaged, as the surveyor or director, is doubtless the person to whom reference is here made.
[7]
Blue Ridge—the most easterly of the mountain ranges of the United States. The name properly restricted however, applies especially to that portion of the Appalachian range south of the Potomac river. In some parts of Pennsylvania it is known as Kittatinny and at some places in Maryland as South Mountain. It attains its greatest altitude in Virginia at the Peaks of Otter, which are about 4,000 feet above sea level.
[8]
Capt. Ashby resided on the Shenandoah river above Burwell's island and the great bend of that stream, at which place he maintained a ferry and kept a house of entertainment. It was on the natural line by which travel came from the tide-water region of Virginia, through a gap in the Blue Ridge and across the Shenandoah valley to the country beyond. Being a
[22]
man of great courage and usefulness, he was deservedly popular among the early settlers, and his name was given not only to his ordinary but also to the gap and to the ferry. There was, too, a Fort Ashby on Patterson creek, near the town of Frankfort. There are numerous families bearing the name of Ashby throughout the southern and western states, who are probably descendants of this famous pioneer. General Turner W. Ashby, an officer of distinction in the Confederate army, is presumably of this family. The name still attaches to the gap in the mountains, but it has been superseded at the old ferry.
[9]
Shenandoah river—this is the largest tributary of the Potomac. The name is of Indian origin, and in the aboriginal language is said to signify "the daughter of the stars." Kercheval, in his History of the Valley of Virginia, says the name was first written Gerando, then Sherandoch, and now we have Shenandoah. The river has its head in Augusta county near the divide where the head-waters of the James river take their rise. The Shenandoah flows for about 170 miles through a broad valley over a limestone bed between the North mountain on the one side and the Blue Ridge on the other, to the Potomac river at Harper's Ferry. This valley was the theater of many important military operations during the late war. The name of Sherando is perpetuated in the name of a post-office in Augusta county on the head-waters of the Shenandoah.

Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord and Baron of Cameron, born in England in 1691, died at his residence "Greenway Court," Frederick county, Virginia, on the 12th of December, 1781. His remains were interred within the Episcopal church of Winchester, Va. His residence and other improvements were familiarly called "Quarters" and "Hunting Lodge," chiefly because he had in contemplation the erection of a commodious mansion. Lord Fairfax was the son of Thomas, 5th Lord Fairfax
[23]
and his wife Catherine, daughter of Lord Culpeper, once governor of Virginia. He was educated at Oxford and afterward held a commission in the British army. He was a fine scholar, and is said to have been a contributor to The Spectator. He succeeded to his father's title and to his mother's extensive landed estate known as the "Northern Neck of Virginia," lying between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers and estimated at 5,700,000 acres. For some years after coming into possession of this property it was left in the hands of agents. He finally employed his cousin, the Hon. William Fairfax, son of Henry and Anne (Harrison) Fairfax, as his agent in the management of his lands. About 1739 Lord Fairfax first visited his estate in America. For a year he devoted himself to becoming thoroughly acquainted with his possessions and then returned to England. Four years later, in 1745, he returned to this country and for a time made his home at "Belvoir," the seat of his relative and agent. 
A branch office for the sale of lands in the valley of Virginia, had been opened in Frederick county in 1742. The main office and records, however, were not removed from "Belvoir" until 1761. 
Lord Fairfax built for himself a stone lodge with quarters for his servants, reserving around it a manor of 10,000 acres which he called "Greenway Court." The lodge was about twelve miles south-east of Winchester, at which place he purposed to build a castle, but this was never erected. His lodge was, however, sufficiently spacious for him to live in comfortably, and exercise a generous hospitality. He possessed a good library and was frequently visited by men of note whom he entertained in an elegant manner. He was fond of the chase and took an active interest in the management of his estate, as well as in the affairs of the colony, as his letters fully prove. He identified himself with the people as far as was practicable, and was deservedly popular. He served as lieutenant of Frederick county in the militia organizations; presided as one of the judges in the county courts at Winchester, and was an overseer of the public roads. 
He met at "Belvoir," George Washington, when a youth, and, pleased with his energy and talents, employed him to survey lands beyond the Blue Ridge, which were to be sold. This was Washington's first remunerated employment. The
[24]
acquaintance thus begun, ripened into a friendship that was cherished by both through life. 
Although a frank loyalist, his age and prudence in refraining from all participation in the Revolutionary struggle, protected him from being interfered with either by the government or by his neighbors. He died at the age of ninety-three, before peace was restored. His barony and its prerogatives, according to English law, descended, in the absence of a son, to his eldest brother, Robert, who thus became 7th Lord Fairfax. The latter died in Leeds Castle, England, 1791, without a son. The baronial title then fell to the Rev. Bryan Fairfax, of "Towlston Hall," Fairfax county, Va., who died 7 August, 1802. The great landed estates with their entails were, however, in effect confiscated by the success of the Revolution. The Legislature of Virginia in 1785 passed an act in relation to the "Northern Neck" to the following effect. "And be it further enacted, that the land holders within the said district of the Northern Neck shall be for ever hereafter exhonorated and discharged from composition and quit rents, any laws, customs or usage, to the contrary notwithstanding." Revised Code of the Laws of Virginia, vol. 1, p. 351, 2, 3. "Greenway Court" was devised by his lordship to his nephew, Rev. Denny Martin, residing in England, on condition of his obtaining the consent of Parliament to change his name to Fairfax. This was done, and he was afterward known as "Denny, Lord Fairfax." Like his uncle, he left no children and therefore bequeathed the estate to two maiden sisters in England. The legatees of the Fairfax estate sold their interest to Chief Justice John Marshall, Raleigh Colston, Esq. and General Henry Lee. They divided it up and sold it out in small farms, and quieted the titles. It is believed that no part of this vast body of Fairfax land is now held by any member of the family.—Sparks, Drake and others.

Capt. Joist Hite came to Virginia from Pennsylvania in 1732 with his family, settled on the Opequon creek about five miles south of the town of Winchester. The year before he had bought from John and Isaac Van Meter a warrant for nearly 40,000 acres of land in the Shenandoah valley which they had obtained from Governor Gooch of Virginia in 1730. Capt. Hite brought with him from Pennsylvania sixteen families, all of whom settled in the same vicinity on fine arable ground. They were all judges of good lands and devoted to agriculture. The descendants of Hite are quite numerous throughout the southern and south-western states, and many farms in the valley are still held under titles derived from him. Kercheval says, Joist Hite built a stone house on the Opequon shortly after his coming to the valley. It is still standing and has a very ancient appearance though there are no discoverable marks to fix the date. On the wall plate of a frame barn, however, built by Hite, the figures "1747" are plainly marked and can still be read.
[12]
"Frederick Town," properly Winchester, is the capital of Frederick county, Va. The latter was formed out of Orange county by Act of Assembly of Virginia in 1738, at the same time that Augusta county was formed. The choice of this site for the capital of the county was determined by the simple fact that a few hardy, adventurous Indian traders, as early as 1732 or even before that date, had built themselves cabins at this point known as the "Big Shawane Springs." These settlers gradually attracted others until a village was developed. This spring or one near it, an example of the great springs which are to be found in most limestone regions, furnishes the town of Winchester, to the present time, with an abundant supply of pure potable water. The site of the town was, all things considered, well chosen, in a fertile region and on the line of travel, whether across the valley to the Alleghany mountains and the waters of the Ohio river beyond, or along the great valley of the Shenandoah. James Wood was the projector of the town of Winchester, which was incorporated in 1752 by the Assembly of Virginia. However, twenty-six lots had been laid out
[26]
and sold by James Wood prior to this. Lord Fairfax shortly after this date made an addition to the town, and donated the ground for an Episcopal church. Frederick county early took measures to give protection to its settlers by building forts, making roads and establishing ferries. Its productive soil at the same time bountifully rewarded the husbandman for his labor. As the Frederick county courts were held at Winchester, the people adopted the southern habit of calling the place where the courts met by the name of the county, thus it was frequently spoken of as Frederick Town and is so designated in several of the early maps. Fort Loudoun was erected here by direction of the Assembly of Virginia in 1756, under the immediate supervision of Major Washington.
[13]
Cate's marsh and Long marsh—these are names of small streams which flow from the foot hill of North mountain to the Shenandoah river and have along their course considerable meadow or marshy land. Long marsh is of sufficient importance to be named upon the maps of Virginia.

[14]
For comments on fleas and other vermin see note 4. Washington's "Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour," p. 14, Washington's association with frontiersmen in their primitive cabins, which the position of a surveyor in the then almost unbroken forest necessitated, was to him a new and peculiar experience. His observations and reflections of the first few days are recorded with a naivete which is truly charming.

This probably has reference to some pernicious weeds unfavorable to tillage and injurious to grazing animals, as St. John's wort. Farmers believe that this, and certain other noxious weeds which occasionally invade pasture fields, cause sore mouths and legs in horses and horned cattle and affect the milk of cows grazing where it grows.

Wednesday 16th We set out early &amp; finish'd about one oClock &amp; then Travell'd up to Frederick Town where our Baggage came to us we cleaned ourselves (to get Rid of y.

Town &amp; thence return'd to our Lodgings where we had a good Dinner prepar'd for us Wine &amp; Rum Punch[17] in Plenty &amp; a good Feather Bed[18] with clean Sheets which was a very agreeable regale.
[16]
This facetious term "game," referring to his misfortune the first night he lodged in the valley, has a touch of humor in it; and while it is true that Washington was not given to punning or indulging in witticisms, he was not deficient in imagination or unappreciative of the exercise of this talent on suitable occasions by others. He knew that good humor minimized most of the petty annoyances of life.
[17]
The office and art of the surveyor were held in high esteem by the early settlers. It is, therefore, not surprising that the people for whom surveys were executed, made special efforts to give the surveying parties good dinners, even going so far as to
[29]
set before them "wine and rum punch." I may add here that there is neither tradition nor record that Washington was ever known to have been indiscreet from youth to age in the use of wine or strong drinks.
[18]
Feather beds, a great luxury in former times, have nearly gone out of use among well-to-do people. By the wealthy, as well as by the laborers, they were once a greatly prized comfort and often devised by will as valuable inheritances. Hair, cotton and spring mattresses have displaced them from popular favor, but "clean sheets" belong to the category of comforts in even early times and must be a delight and joy forever.

Cohongoruton—the Indian name by which the Potomac river was known to the Six Nations and other tribes of Indians. From its head-waters, to Point Lookout in the Chesapeake bay, this stream is the dividing line between Maryland and Virginia.
[20]
The "Warm Springs," now known as "Bath" or "Berkeley Springs," were already famed, as Washington notes, in
[30]
1747. They were deservedly popular for many years, but their remoteness and the difficulty of access to them, with the competition of other resorts more easily reached, prevented their receiving the attention which the value of their waters merited. A settlement sprang up about the springs at an early date, which finally became a prosperous village under the name of Bath, and was made the county seat when, in 1820, the county of Morgan was formed. Washington bought lots here, built a cottage and stables, and passed summers here with his family. His half-brother, Lawrence, spent nearly a year at the springs for the benefit of his health before going to England and later to Barbadoes. The property-right in the springs is in the state of Virginia, and is held for the benefit of the public.

[21]
Cresap, Col. Thomas, the founder of the family in America, was born in Skipton, Yorkshire, England, and at the age of about fifteen came to America. Some five years later he resided at Havre-de-Grace, Md., where he married a Miss Johnson. Removing thence to Wright's Ferry, opposite the town of Columbia, where he obtained a Maryland title to a 500 acre tract of land called "Peach Bottom," and built himself a small stone house. The land, however, was on disputed territory, and claimants under the laws of Pennsylvania finally dispossessed him. His next move was to a locality in what is now Washington county, Md., where he located and settled upon a
[31]
tract of 1,400 acres on the Antietam creek, called "Long Meadows," and began trading with the Indians. After collecting a large lot of furs and skins he shipped them to England but was financially ruined through the capture of the vessel by the French. Unable to repay money he had borrowed from Mr. Dulany, of Maryland, he gave up to him his land, and moved farther west, built a cabin a few miles above the junction of the north and south branches of the Potomac, on the Maryland side, at a place which became known as "Old Town," but which he called Skipton, the name of his Yorkshire birthplace. This frontier spot became his permanent residence, where he eventually owned a large body of land on both sides of the Potomac. From his familiarity with the Indians and their habits and character, he was enabled to carry on with great advantage his trade with them and in time became the most important frontiersman of his day in Maryland. He took part with the Washingtons, Lee, Mason and others in the formation and early operations of "The Ohio Company," and in all matters of dealing with the Indians and prospecting for wild lands was the Company's chief dependence. With the aid of Namacolin, a noted Indian hunter, he laid out the first road over the Alleghany mountains to the head-waters of the Ohio. Gen. Braddock's expedition, and later the National road, followed nearly the same route. The attention attracted to the Ohio region through this Company's explorations, made it increasingly important to both England and France to possess and control the lands beyond the Ohio. This vigilance precipitated the war that drove out the French and secured to England and America the vast dominion known as the Northwest. 
Col. Cresap's literary acquirements were small, but he had a vigorous mind, strong common sense, and was not deficient in practical self-education. He was one of the surveyors of Prince George's county which, at that period, embraced all the western part of Maryland. January 1, 1745, he surveyed for Gov. Thomas Bladen "Walnut Bottom" just below the mouth of Wills creek. He frequently represented his county in the Legislature and being noted for his clear understanding, sound judgment, firmness and courage, was esteemed one of the best legislators his county ever had. He was of medium stature, firmly set, of sound constitution, and lived to the uncommon
[32]
age of 105 or 106. He was twice married, the second time at the age of 80; by his first wife he had five children; three sons, Daniel, Thomas and Michael, and two daughters, Sarah and Elizabeth. Captain Michael Cresap was the person upon whom Thomas Jefferson fixed the stigma of the murder of the relatives of Logan. Jefferson having transmitted the pathetic speech of the Indian chief to the Abbe Raynal as an evidence of the original power of oratory of the aboriginal American, it is claimed more in a spirit of literary conceit than of conviction; however he failed during his life to correct the injustice done Cresap, although he was repeatedly furnished with the evidence exculpating Cresap and fixing the barbarous act on one Great-house. At his home, Col. Cresap dispensed, for his time and means, a generous hospitality to all callers, in a region where, as yet, no public houses were to be found. He kept a big kettle ready suspended to place a fire under, near a spring for the use of the Indians who often passed his place, and for this reason they designated him the "Big Spoon." Lord Baltimore employed him to run a survey of the western line of Maryland, and to ascertain which of the two branches of the Potomac was the largest. His autograph map of this survey is still preserved in the archives of the state of Maryland.
[22]
The South Branch of the Potomac, of which the Indian name was Wappotomaka, rises in Pendleton county, West Virginia, among the spurs of the Alleghany and North mountains, and meets the North Branch about 20 miles below Cumberland, Md. The latter branch has been accepted as the dividing line between Maryland and Virginia, although now known to be neither as long nor as large as the South Branch. A line drawn due north from the extreme head-waters of the South Branch would run ten miles to the west of a parallel line from the head springs of the North Branch, thus proving the loss by Maryland of this strip of territory, as well as the region between the two branches, had the South Branch been taken instead of the North Branch as the main river referred to in the Royal Charter, and made the line separating the contiguous colonies. The valley through which the South Branch flows is broad and its lands very fertile, causing them to be much sought after for farms by the hardy pioneers in the early days before the Revolution. It was then familiarly known as the "upper tract" of Virginia.

[23]
Scalp—a term applied to the tissues covering the human head, and embracing all the hairy integuments and flattened muscles from the back of the skull to the brow above the eyes. Taking the scalp of an enemy, living or dead, has been held from remote times as a special sign of victory and token of triumph. The North American Indians, particularly during the early colonial wars, took the scalps of their enemies, preserving and exhibiting them with savage pride and occasionally wearing them as decorations and trophies. The assembly of Virginia, in 1755, established a reward of £10 for every scalp
[34]
of a male Indian above the age of twelve (Hening's Statutes, vol. VI, p. 551). In 1757 this sum was raised to £15, and £30 more for every scalp taken within the next two years (Hening, VII, p. 122). Maryland and Pennsylvania also offered rewards for Indian scalps.
[24]
The war dance of the Indians probably had a significance to their minds not understood by civilized man, and was not to them the meaningless custom it seems to us. It has frequently been described and painted by eye-witnesses. In 1857 Virtue, Emmins &amp; Co. copyrighted a very effective engraving of a war dance in the forest, arranged from Washington's description of it in this journal.

[25]
Paterson Creek rises in Hampshire county, West Virginia, and empties into the Potomac about twelve miles below Cumberland, Md. On the old maps of Evans, Hutchins and Lewis, the name is given as Pattison. There are large tracts of good, arable land along the valley and bottoms adjacent to this stream. They began to attract settlements a little before the time Fort Cumberland was built. Fort Ashby was also erected to protect settlers along this stream.

Saterday 26 Travelld up ye Creek to Solomon Hedges Esqr one of his Majestys Justices of ye Peace for ye County of Frederick where we camped when we came to Supper there was neither a Cloth upon ye Table nor a Knife to eat with but as good luck would have it we had Knives of own.[26]
[26]
Knife and fork at table.—Polished nations have usages
[35]
which, at first view, appear natural or common to all mankind. This, however, is not the fact. That there was a period in the history of our race when the knife and fork were unknown to the furnishings of the table, cannot well be doubted; and there was even a time when the table itself was not deemed an essential. At the present day the idea of eating a meal at table without the accompaniment of a knife and fork would excite disgust; their absence, however, in a remote Virginia mountain cabin in 1747-8 as here recorded, simply shows that they had not been provided nor deemed essential to the life of a hunter, not an ignorance of their use, as the two-pronged, iron, table fork was in common use at that period throughout the settlements in all the American colonies. It is nevertheless true that the knife and fork now deemed so necessary at table, are a much more modern convenience than is generally supposed. The king of Hungary, Coevinus, toward the close of the fifteenth century, as related by Galeotus Martius, ate his meat with his fingers as did all the guests at table. In Italy, the fork was, to a limited extent, in use at this time among the nobility. In France, at the end of the sixteenth century, forks were comparatively new at court. The use of the table fork is referred to in "Washington's Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour," and in Hawkins' Youths' Companion, the source of these rules printed about 1650. The knife is perhaps one of the most ancient of instruments, it was made of different metals and in a great variety of forms. The table knife was, however, contemporary with the fork. According to Chamberlin it was first made in England, in 1563. The use of the fork at table spread to Europe from Venice, in Italy. In 1608 it was brought to England by Thomas Coryate who, while traveling, observed its use in Italy and continued it himself on his return to England. (See his work entitled "Crudities.") It is rather disappointing that neither the Greeks nor Romans have even a name for the table fork. The flesh fork, called creagra, with a long handle, for cooks to take meat out of a boiling pot, was known and used by the Hebrews and the Greeks. But had the table fork been used by the latter or by the Romans, some specimens would have been found among those extensive ruins which have been so carefully explored by modern investigators. It is known that some articles have been found, the use of which conjecture assigns to the table,
[36]
but they are not forks and the surmise is not generally credited. The Chinese, who claim to have led the rest of the world in most of the economic inventions, seem to have overlooked the table fork and do not even now use it in cutting or conveying food to the mouth but employ in its stead the "chop sticks" which, it must be said in their praise, they use with skill and dexterity. It should be stated that large bronze forks were used by the Egyptians in presenting offerings to the gods. It is unpleasant to represent the tables of our ancestors of a few centuries back as without forks, yet this certainly was the fact. The silver table fork, which also had its evolution from two to four prongs, was first manufactured in 1662 by Heylin. 
The small knife, formerly worn by gentlemen at their girdles, was used by them, not only as a weapon of defense, but also as an article of convenience in cutting their meat. However, the ancient custom of serving food at table was to have a servant cut meats and other food into small morsels before distributing it to guests. The wealthy employed a person whose special duty it was to carve the meats into proper and convenient pieces and his was the only knife in the dining hall. When the fork was first introduced into England, its employment was ridiculed as an effeminate practice, as may be seen in the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, and others where the persons using it are referred to as "your fork-carving-traveler."

Sunday 27th Travell'd over to y. South Branch attended with y. Esqr to Henry Vanmetriss[27] in order to go about Intended Work of Lots[28]
[27]
Henry Van Metre or Meter.—There was a numerous family of the Van Meters in Virginia and they were among the earliest settlers in the valley of the Shenandoah, on the South Branch and along the upper Potomac. Kercheval, in his History of the Valley of Virginia, says this family came from New York and New Jersey. It is evident that they were people of energy and thrift, judges of good land. At a period antedating the settlements in the valley, it is stated by this historian that a John Van Meter, a sort of wandering Indian trader, of New York, accompanied the Delaware Indians in a war party against the Catawbas; but the Catawbas anticipating the attack,
[37]
surprised and defeated the Delawares in a battle fought near where the present court-house of Pendleton stands. John Van Meter escaped and returned to New York, but he was so impressed with the beauty and fertility of the lands on the South Branch bottom in Hardy county, that he advised his sons to secure lands and locate there. Of these sons, Isaac became a man of note and frequently represented Hardy county in the House of Delegates of Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia Convention of 1788 which ratified the Federal Constitution. In 1730, it is a matter of history that John and Isaac Van Metre, brothers, obtained from Gov. Gooch, of Virginia, a warrant for 40,000 acres of land to be located west of the mountains. This warrant, or a part of it, they sold to Joist Hite. A number of tracts on the original warrant were surveyed in the vicinity of Shepherdstown. The name of Van Meter is still frequently met with throughout West Virginia and has its monument in a stream forming the north-western boundary line of Jefferson county and emptying into the Potomac, and named on the maps of Virginia Van Meter's Marsh. A controversy as to the validity of the Van Metre patent was raised in 1738 by Lord Fairfax and taken into the courts for adjudication. Lord Fairfax contending that his grants covered the whole of the western end of the northern neck, while the holders claimed that the governor, under authority from the crown, had disposing power. This conflict as to title was a source of much litigation, and was not finally settled until after the Revolution, when all the parties to the original suits were dead.
[28]
Lots.—This term, as used by surveyors, indicates portions, tracts, divisions and subdivisions of land. Each survey, lot or division when plotted is usually indicated by some name or device, as a number, a letter, or a symbol. So that each can then be described and referred to in a deed or an advertisement, and its location and boundaries be accurately and systematically defined and described in a book of land records.

James Rutledge.—Kercheval, in his History of the Valley
[38]
of Virginia, says that prominent among the earliest settlers on the South Branch, before the arrival of the Van Meters, were the Howards, Coburns, Walkers and Rutledges.

Tuesday 29th This Morning went out &amp; Survey'd five Hundred Acres of Land &amp; went down to one Michael Stumps on ye So Fork of ye Branch on our way Shot two Wild Turkies[30]
[30]
The wild turkey.—This is the largest and finest of our game birds and, although native to North America, it bears a foreign name from the following circumstances. Specimens of the living bird, as well as its eggs, were sent by the early Jesuit missionaries to the old world on Spanish and Portuguese ships, entering Europe through Portugal. It was as yet unnamed, and was at first referred to by writers of that period merely as the "Jesuit bird." As it became known, the demand for the stranger was supplied chiefly from Turkey where, for some reason, it thrived exceedingly well, and in time it came to be familiarly spoken of as "the turkey." Gradually becoming tame, and proving to be quite prolific, it was recognized as a great addition to the luxuries of the table. Speedily becoming a favorite in every country to which it was taken, the great forests and game preserves throughout Europe were gradually stocked with it and it was also raised as a domestic fowl. To-day the American turkey, derived as stated, is found wild in all the great forests of the old world, while the domesticated bird is abundantly raised everywhere in Europe for the markets. In ancient times, we are told, the choicest game fowls brought to a feast were pheasants and peacocks. Emigrants to America brought over with them the domesticated bird to its native land, but under a borrowed name. Washington, in his journal, April 7, 1748, records the fact that one of his men that day had killed a wild turkey weighing 20 pounds. The domesticated bird, when permitted to attain the age of two or three years, and being well fed during the winter months, often reaches the weight of 30 pounds or more. As marking in a degree the devastation of the late war and the enforced abandonment of plantations in the section of Virginia adjacent to the city of Washington, it is a fact worthy of record, that in
[39]
1876 the newspapers chronicled the news that the thickets and pine forests which were grown up since the armies left were tenanted by wild deer and turkeys; foxes, etc. And to this day, December 25, 1890, wild turkeys are brought to the Washington market killed in Fairfax county, Va., within ten miles of Washington city.—Gentlemen's Magazine.

Manor line.—In colonial times there were a number of manors, or great landed estates, granted under the then existing laws of England, to persons of note and quality in Virginia and in some of the other provinces. Holders of such estates enjoyed special rights and privileges. Manors were formerly called baronies and entitled the rightful possessor to lordships, and such lord or baron was empowered to hold domestic courts for redressing misdemeanors, nuisances and settling disputes among tenants. Among the manors of limited privileges in Virginia may be enumerated the "manor of Greenway Court," with a domain of 10,000 acres. The great "manor of Leeds," which has figured so extensively in the courts of Virginia, contained 150,000 acres within the counties of Culpeper, Fauquier and Frederick. The "South Branch manor," in Hardy county, embraced 55,000 acres; "Paterson Creek manor," in Hampshire county, 9,000 acres; and "Goony Run manor," adjoining that of Leeds and lying chiefly in Shenandoah county, 13,000
[40]
acres. "Beverley's manor," for the most part in Augusta county, consisted of 118,411 acres, and "Fairfax manor," in Hampshire, of 10,000 acres. There were still other manors in different parts of the state. In New York under the Dutch government the baron or proprietor of the manor lands was called the patroon.
[32]
Clay lick.—Names of places or streams with the word lick either prefixed or affixed to them, such as "Salt lick," "Blue lick," "Grass lick," "Licking creek," etc., were usually given in consequence of the presence of some saline matter in the springs, streams or soil which attracted the wild animals and caused them to lick for the salt. Hunters in new settlements often built what they called blinds near these licks in which to conceal themselves, and waited there for the game to come, as they were pretty sure to do, almost daily, and at times in considerable numbers, when they could be readily killed.

[33]
"Wappacomo," also spelled "Wappatomaka," was the Indian name for the South Branch of the Potomac. This stream courses through a fine valley from its head-springs in Pendleton county, and has many considerable branches rising among the spurs of the Alleghany mountains on the one side and the North or Cacapehon (Capon) mountain on the other, the latter separating it from the valley of Virginia on the east. The great or most noted fork of the South Branch is at Morefield in Hardy county. Washington surveyed much of the land in that section. The young farmers seeking good lands had come in taken up considerable tracts and built improvements before surveys were made or any effort to prove rights from either Lord Fairfax or the governor of Virginia.

Vacant—this term, as used by surveyors, indicates that the tract of land so designated is neither claimed by an actual occupant or occupied by virtue of any official record. Many of the settlers on the lands of Lord Fairfax selected their farms and made improvements without any legal survey, warrant or title, other than a "tomahawk blaze" for a boundary mark, trusting that the actual owner of the land would recognize the improvement and occupant's claim and deal justly by them. These "tomahawk claims" were respected by the actual settlers, had a market value among land speculators and were admitted, to a certain extent, as evidence of rights in the courts.

Dutch.—As early as 1730 there was a considerable settlement in the Shenandoah valley, of German immigrants and their descendants, who had first settled in Pennsylvania and then removed to, and taken up lands in, the valley of Virginia. They selected, chiefly, the good limestone lands with their centers of population near the head-waters of the Opequon creek, in Shenandoah, and the south-western part of Frederick county. They were all Protestants in religion. The town of Woodstock was originally and exclusively settled by Germans. The bill for its incorporation was reported to the House of Burgesses of Va., by Col. George Washington in 1761. For many years the German language was exclusively spoken in their settlement, and German customs and religious observances were retained
[46]
with tenacity, their remoteness and seclusion securing to them almost perfect freedom from innovations. The Revolution found them patriotic supporters of the colony as against the pretensions of Great Britain. It was in the town of Woodstock, Shenandoah county, that Maj.-Gen. John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, minister of the Lutheran church, dressed in his uniform and with his sword buckled on, preached a farewell sermon in 1776, to a sympathizing and patriotic congregation, and the next day marched as colonel at the head of his German regiment, known subsequently as the 8th Virginia, to join the Continental army. Such names of places as Strasburg, Hamburg, Mecklenburg, the latter now known as Shepherdstown, etc., perpetuate the fact that many of the earliest settlers in that section were German.—See Kercheval, p. 158.

The Red Bud or Judas tree.—A common tree that grows wild in the United States. In botany it is known as the "Cercis Canadensis," and often grows to the height of 30 feet or more. It flowers in April, clothing its limbs in a reddish-purple bloom for a week or ten days before its leaves appear, and from this circumstance it is popularly called red bud.
[37]
Blazed trees.—These are surveyors' marks made on trees to proclaim and identify certain routes or lines. The "blaze" is made by removing with an axe a strip of the outer bark of a tree or sapling, for about a foot in length and well into the inner bark. In the future growth of the tree a lighter color marks the cicatrix which rarely ever wholly disappears. Surveyors, to distinguish corner trees in a survey, not only blaze the sides of the tree in the direction their lines run but cut three small notches through the bark which will remain distinct during the life of the tree.
[38]
Widow Wolf.—There was a Fort Wolf on Stony creek a few miles south-west of Woodstock, erected by the Germans at an early period in the settlement of the valley; there is also a marsh or creek named Wolf's marsh, which empties into the Shenandoah about twelve miles above Ashby's Ferry. Possibly these were so called from the name of this widow's husband.

Old Fields and Wild Meadow.—There were many small, timberless tracts of land on the mountains and in the great valleys of Virginia and Pennsylvania, in regions which were generally, prior to the occupation and the clearing up of the country by the white man, densely covered with trees. Large tracts of such timberless land existed in the region now embraced within the counties of Berkeley, Jefferson and Frederick. Strange as it may appear some of this kind of land within the history of the settlement of the valley became covered with young forest timber. In some respects these openings resembled the treeless prairies of the west. No satisfactory explanation of this frequently observed condition has ever been given. Many of these meadows were the favorite pasturing grounds of the large game and were, therefore, of special interest to the hunter. Clearfield county, Pa., it is believed, got its name from the fact that there were within its territory extensive natural clear fields and meadows.

From the expression, "set the surveyor to work," as well as the language used in the record on the 12th of March, that "Mr. James Genn the surveyor came to us and traveled over the Blue Ridge, etc.," with other expressions at a later date of similar import in the journal and in other documents, it is rendered almost certain that George Washington was, from the first, employed by Lord Fairfax, not as a surveyor, merely, but rather in the capacity of a skilled director of other surveyors, and as the confidential adviser in the division and sale of his lordship's lands.

[41]
Williams' Gap, in the Blue Ridge, is on a line nearly due east from Winchester. It derived its name from a Mr. Williams, who kept a ferry over the Shenandoah river on one of the roads from Winchester into Loudoun and Fairfax counties. This name still attaches to the gap and appears on the early maps of Virginia. It is a notable fact that all or most of the important gaps through mountain passes in the United States were well worn buffalo paths and Indian trails when first visited by white men.
[42]
Ashby's Bent is supposed to have reference to the great bend and extensive bottom lands of the Shenandoah, just above which was located Captain Ashby's ferry across that river. Washington uses this term in 1770 to describe a large tract of bottom land on the Ohio which he acquired.
[43]
Fairfax county, in which Mount Vernon is located, was created out of Prince William county by the Assembly of Virginia in 1742.

[44]
Major Lawrence Washington, proprietor of Mount Vernon, was the second child and oldest surviving son of Augustine and his first wife Jane (Butler) Washington, born at Pope's Creek, Westmoreland county, Va., in 1718, and died at his residence, Mount Vernon, 26th July, 1752. He was the half-brother of the illustrious George Washington and great-grandson of the emigrant, Col. John Washington, who came to Virginia
[53]
about 1657. It is a matter of tradition that Lawrence was at about the age of 15 sent to England to be educated, and leaving college he received a captain's commission to serve in a regiment raised in Virginia to take part in the expedition against Carthegenia, 1740-42, under the command of Admiral Vernon. 
The expedition failed of its purpose, and Major Lawrence Washington returned to Virginia in the fall of 1742. He shortly after became engaged to Anne Fairfax, which induced him to resign from the army. His father died April 12, 1743, leaving a considerable estate and named him, his oldest son, one of his executors. He inherited from his father "the Hunting creek" plantation, consisting of 2,500 acres, on the Potomac but a few miles from and in sight of "Belvoir." On the 19th of July Lawrence Washington was united in marriage to Anne, eldest daughter of the Hon. William Fairfax of "Belvoir." He made many improvements on his plantation and gave it the name of "Mount Vernon," in compliment to his old commander, Admiral Vernon. Lawrence Washington had received a good education, had mixed with prominent personages, had seen much of the world, and was a man of good habits and business qualifications. 
His father at the time of his death, was largely engaged in business which Lawrence was obliged to look after and close up. This gradually led him into various business enterprises; such as the manufacturing of iron, buying and selling land, etc. He and his brother Augustin were among the organizers of "The Ohio Company," to explore the western country, encourage settlements, and conduct a trade with the Indians. He was elected to the House of Burgesses of Virginia from Fairfax county in 1748. It was largely through his influence that a charter was granted to the towns of Alexandria and Colchester, both in Fairfax county. He together with Lord Fairfax, George Mason, Hon. William Fairfax, William Ramsay, John Carlyle and others was named as trustee to lay out and govern the town. He was a popular legislator, but declined to serve longer in the Assembly, as it interfered with his present business. He was greatly attached to his brother George, and made it a point to have him with him at Mount Vernon whenever it was practicable without interrupting his studies. Lawrence was always of a delicate constitution, but by his prudent habits and systematic
[54]
attention to business he accomplished a great deal and enhanced the value of his possessions. He was tall in stature and a man of fine personal appearance, as is shown by an oil painting of him which still hangs upon the wall of the Virginia room in Mount Vernon mansion. He was rapidly becoming one of the leading business men of Virginia, when his health broke down. As a last resort his physicians recommended that he should spend a winter in the West Indies. In the fall of 1751, he resigned his commission as one of the adjutant-generals of Virginia, and taking his brother George with him, he went to the Island of Barbadoes. His pulmonary trouble had progressed too far to be arrested, and after spending some five months on the Island, and finding himself declining he returned home and died in July, 1752. His marriage had been blessed by four children, three of whom had died, his surviving child, Sarah, was still an infant at the time of her father's death. After providing in his will for his wife he left Mount Vernon to his daughter, but in the event of her death without heirs it was to go to his "beloved brother George," who was also named as one of his executors. This daughter Sarah died within a year, and George inherited Mount Vernon before he was 21 years of age. A few years after Lawrence Washington's death, his widow married George Lee, brother to the father of Arthur and Richard Henry Lee, patriots in the Revolution.

The note book which contains this journal of Washington's includes also other memoranda, such as notes of surveys, drafts of juvenile letters, verses, etc., all of which are of interest for the glimpses they give of the character and early life of their author, and are copied with literal exactness and given with the journal and surveys.

Frederick county, Virginia, was formed by Act of Assembly in 1738, out of Orange county at the same time that Augusta county was created. The boundaries of Frederick county were measurably well defined; to Augusta, however, was left all the western territory belonging to Virginia, much of it at that time an unexplored wilderness. This immense area has since been divided and now forms four great and independent states of the Union, namely, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois. Frederick county, by a return of the effective militia made to the governor of Virginia in 1777, had but 923 men. The total population of the town of Winchester at that time was 800 and a fraction.—Kercheval.

At this place in the journal three leaves, six pages, have been torn out. The edges left show that they had been written upon by Washington. The next record of a survey in the hand-writing of Washington is signed by him with the name of James Genn, as is also the incomplete plot of a survey here reproduced from the original by tracing; whether it is a study from field notes by James Genn or an actual survey by Washington himself does not appear. The paper upon which it is drawn and the style of the hand-writing, place it as of a date current with the added records of 1747-8.

Alexandria, Virginia.—This seems to be a brief record of the course and distances of a survey by Washington of the shore-line of the town of Alexandria before the river bank was improved or altered by the building of wharves and the grading of streets. It is probable that these lines were run in the winter when the river was closed with ice.

[49]
This appears to have been a study for a letter to some youthful companion. Even to the close of his life it was the habit of Washington, in writing important letters and papers, to make rough drafts of them as a study. However, in copying them off, he frequently changed expressions and amplified their contents as his judgment approved. The original drafts of many of his letters are preserved in the Department of State at Washington and illustrate this fact. Hence the transcripts in his letter-book are not always true copies of either his drafts or his original autograph letters. These drafts were kept by him as memoranda, rather than as exact copies. It is also probable that there are many drafts preserved of letters which were never actually sent. In some cases he endorses this fact upon drafts of letters.

Dear Friend John[50]

[50]
Dear Sir, Dear Friend John, and Dear Friend Robin.—These all seem to be studies or drafts of letters, which may have been impersonal or possibly to his youthful school-fellows and companions in Westmoreland and Stafford counties. It would be idle to speculate as to whom they were intended, in the absence of more definite information. They are in no wise remarkable, except as evidences of Washington's life-long habit of making memoranda, drafts and studies of his letters.
[59]

[51]
The young lady indicated was Miss Mary Cary, the daughter of Colonel Wilson Cary, of Ceeleys Hampton, Elisabeth City county, Va. For 34 years Mr. Cary was collector of customs
[60]
for the lower James river district, and a man of large wealth and aristocratic notions. He had four daughters: Sarah, who married George W. Fairfax, of "Belvoir"; Mary, who married in 1754, Edward Ambler of Jamestown; Anna, who married Robert Carter Nicholas; and Elizabeth, who married Rev. Bryan, 8th Lord Fairfax. Col. Cary had also one son Wilson Miles Cary, who was a member of the Convention of Virginia in 1776. Some writers have confounded him with his father. Bishop Meade in his Old Churches and Families of Virginia, accepts traditions which other writers claim are authenticated by documents, preserved by the Ambler family, and accordingly his account credits the story that Washington, in his youth, was an ardent admirer of Miss Mary Cary, and solicited leave of Col. Cary to address his daughter, but was refused. (See Meade, vol. i, 108.) This draft of the letter addressed to "Dear Friend Robin," was probably made in the spring of 1748, when Washington was in his seventeenth year. In it, he playfully avows an admiration for the "lowland beauty" and, at the same time, admits the agreeableness of the "young lady in the house" with him at "Belvoir." Mr. Edward Ambler, educated at Cambridge, England, was collector for York river and a burgess for Jamestown. He died in 1768 in his thirty-fifth year and was buried at Jamestown; his widow survived him until 1781. Mrs. Ambler with her children and her sister, Mrs. Fairfax, were occasionally guests at Mount Vernon, as Washington's diaries show. I am inclined to believe that while it is true that Washington entertained a high regard for the Cary family and particularly the ladies, there is nothing but the lightest gossip to create an inference that there ever was even an incipient affair of the heart between either of the Misses Cary and Washington.
[52]
Lowland beauty.—Who this object of Washington's early admiration was, if she had a veritable existence, is not positively known. Irving, followed by Everett and others, accepts the tradition, or rather surmises, that this sobriquet referred to Miss Lucy Grymes of Westmoreland county, who in 1753 married Henry Lee, Esq. Their son was the gallant General Henry Lee, "Lighthorse Harry," of the Revolution. Some recent writers, affect to believe that this draft of a letter is conclusive that there was a real love affair but that Betsy
[61]
Fauntleroy, of Fredericksburg, Va., was the person referred to, and have published a letter purporting to have been addressed by Washington to William Fauntleroy, Sr., Esq., in Richmond, enclosing one to Miss Betsy, who, it is made to appear, had also refused Washington's addresses. Letters and traditions of this character should be received with caution, for while vague reports and surmises of an affair of the heart may be dilated upon in a bantering way among friends of the parties where there is little or no foundation for the allegation, yet they should be subjected to scrutiny and some positive evidence adduced before they are accepted as historical facts.

Dear Sally
This comes to Fredericksburg fair in hopes of meeting with a speedy Passage to you if your not there which hope you'l get shortly altho I am almost discouraged from writing to you as this is my fouth to you since I receiv'd any from yourself I hope you'l not make the Old Proverb good out of sight out of Mind as its one of the greatest Pleasures I can yet foresee of having in Fairfax in often hearing from you hope you'l not deny it me

[53]
The minuteness of detail is very characteristic of the writer. While Washington was observant of the proprieties of life and of good taste in dress, there was not the least leaning to foppishness. But it was a principle with him to have whatever he bought, consonant with good taste and of the best quality.
[54]
At this point in the book there are 18 blank pages.

Dear Richard
The Receipt of your kind favour of the 2d of this Instant afforded me unspeakable pleasure as I am convinced I am still in the Memory of so Worthy a friend a friendship I shall ever be proud of Increasing you gave me the more pleasure as I receiv'd it amongst a parcel of Barbarians and an uncooth set of People the like favour often repeated would give me Pleasure

[55]
A Pistole.—This coin was worth, at the time Washington wrote this journal, about $3.60. A doubloon was worth twice that amount.

[56]
Cacapehon, now generally written Capon.—There are two streams in the same vicinity known by this name, and to distinguish them, one is called "Great Capon" and the other "Little Capon." Both are tributaries to the Potomac.
[57]
Fifteen Mile creek rises in Maryland and flows in a south-easterly direction, emptying into the Potomac river between Sideling Hill creek and Town creek, about 15 miles above Hancock, Md.
[64]
[58]
"The Ohio Company" grew into existence out of efforts by Virginians, dated as early as 1746 or 1747, to secure a share in the lucrative Indian trade, and with the prospect of opening to settlement the lands on the upper waters of the Ohio. An early move in this direction had been made by Colonel Thomas Cresap, a man of courage, judgment and enterprise—qualities required for trading successfully with the Indians. He had erected his cabin at Oldtown, Md. About 1746 Lawrence and Augustine Washington, after making some cautious business ventures in the Indian trade, with others assisted to organize "this Ohio Company." Thomas Lee, whose second son, Richard Henry Lee, was to become so conspicuous a patriot of the Revolution, and John Hanbury, a wealthy London merchant, were original members of this company, into which still other men of substance and standing were admitted, and to which, in 1749, the British government gave a charter, as "The Ohio Company," with a grant of half a million acres of land, to be located between the Monongahela and Kanawha rivers, on the south side of the Ohio. With but twenty shares of stock at first issue, the company's prosperity seemed assured, and both Governor Dinwiddie and George Mason, at a later date purchased an interest in it. Among the early Washington manuscripts appears the above memorandum of a survey for this company. Although this entry is without date it must have been earlier, judging from its position in the note-book, than the charter. This document imposed, as conditions of the land grant, that the company should at once survey two hundred thousand acres, and within seven years secure the settlement of not less than one hundred families, erect forts, and maintain a garrison against the Indians,—conditions on the fulfilment of which they were to be for ten years exempt from the payment of quit-rents. Mr. Christopher Gist was employed as the company's agent, and on October 19, 1749, entered upon his duties of inspecting the country, contiguous to the Ohio river, reporting upon the character of the lands, making surveys, keeping a journal of his observations, drawing plans of the territory, etc. In 1750 the company built a small store-house at Will's creek and stocked it with goods from London to the value of £4,000. In 1752 Mr. Gist held a council with the Indians on the Ohio in behalf of the company, and secured their permission to lay out a town and erect a fort at McKee's
[65]
Rocks at the mouth of Chartier's creek, upon the east side of the Ohio, a few miles below Pittsburg. Washington, in his diary, alludes to this, and says of the position: "I think it greatly inferior, either for defense or advantage, especially the latter: For a fort at the forks would be equally well situated on the Ohio, and have the entire command of the Monongahela." In 1751 the company began making a road to the mouth of the Monongahela, but for lack of adequate resources, made only slow progress. The company looked upon the lands around Will's creek as being within their grant. They also erected a store-house at the mouth of Redstone on the Monongahela and began some improvements at the forks of the Ohio, immediately after completing those at Will's creek. At the latter place they had the adjacent lands surveyed on both sides the stream, above and below the forks, and laid out a town to which they gave the name of Charlottesburg in honor of the Princess Charlotte, afterward wife of King George. The French and Indian war, with other stirring political events, compelled the company to be cautious and to contract its operations, but, its embarrassments increasing from the course pursued toward it by the English government, prompted by envious rival interests, the consent of its agent, George Mercer, Esq., was finally gained to merge the Ohio Company into a Grand Company, under what was known as the Walpole Grant or Company. Their proposal was as follows: "We, the Committee of the Purchasers of a Tract of Country for a new Province on the Ohio in America, do hereby admit the Ohio Company as a Co-Purchaser with us for two shares of the said Purchase,* in Consideration of the Engagement of their Agent, Col. Mercer, to withdraw the application of the said Company for a separate Grant within the Limits of the said Purchase. 
Witness our Hands this 7th Day of May 1770 
* The whole being divided into seventy-two equal Shares by the words "two shares" above is understood two Seventy-second parts of the Tract so as above Purchased.

This action, however, was not approved by the American

members of the company, and the final collapse of the whole enterprise was one of the results of the Revolution.

Memorandum or draft of a letter to his sister-in-law Anne, wife of Lawrence Washington, of Mount Vernon, made, very possibly, while in the field surveying in the fall of 1748 or spring of 1749. This visit to Europe, of Lawrence Washington, was partly in the interest of the Ohio Company and partly on account of his failing health which, unfortunately, was not benefited by the voyage as had been hoped.

[60]
Mrs. Aus. Washington evidently refers to Mrs. Augustine Washington, of Westmoreland, the wife of George's half-brother, Augustine, with whom he had made his home while attending Mr. William's Academy. Austin is, or has been, in Virginia a contraction for Augustine. Augustine Moore, a notable character, is recorded interchangeably, in land and other records, as Augustine and as Austin Moore. It is presumed that "The Maryland Housewife" was intended to have been written, that being the name of a popular book on cookery and the art of housekeeping at that period. The date of this memorandum
[67]
is presumed to be 1748. A charge in his book of accounts kept at this time, and which was among the relics of Lawrence Washington sold in Philadelphia in the spring of 1891, would fix the date as July 28th, 1748. It was not an unusual thing for Washington in his youth to use contractions in writing the first names of his brothers, the following are examples: Aus., Austin for Augustine; Sam for Samuel; Jack and John, simply for John Augustine.

[61]
This is about the only record Washington has left of his course of reading. It is inferred that the books were either at "Greenway Court" or at "Belvoir." The character of the works he selected for his perusal is what might have been expected. This memorandum also exhibits a trait in his character prominent throughout his life, that of giving attention to minute details of business. It may truly be said of him that "the boy was father to the man."
[62]
Honorable William Fairfax, of "Belvoir," Fairfax county, Va., was born 1691 in Yorkshire, England, where his father that year became high sheriff of the county. His father was the son of Henry Fairfax, 2d son of 4th Lord Fairfax and Anna (Harrison) Fairfax, whose sister, Eleanora Harrison, of South Cave, married in 1689, Henry Washington; their son, Richard Washington, who resided in London, was, therefore, an English cousin of Wm. Fairfax, and a correspondent both of his and of Col. George Washington's (see Washington's correspondence,
[68]
in Sparks). Wm. Fairfax lost his father when quite young and was educated at his uncle's, Sir John Lowther's College. Through the influence of Capt. Fairfax, of the Royal Navy, he entered that service in 1710 and served for two years. He then joined the British army in Spain under Col. Martin Bladen, who had married a Fairfax, and was stationed at St. Helena in 1716-17, and subsequently at the Bahamas, and returned to England in October, 1717. Having married in the Bahamas, Sarah, daughter of Maj. Walker, of Nassau, she accompanied him to England. In 1718 Wm. Fairfax was sent out with Captain or Governor Woodes Rogers as chief justice to suppress the pirates infesting the West Indies. His residence was at Nassau, New Providence. The business for which he accepted office having been completed and the climate not being congenial, he in 1725 removed to New England. Here he received an appointment to the custom house at Salem, which he held until 1734. While a resident of Salem, his first wife died and was buried there. His son George William was born in Nassau, three of his children were born in Salem. Thomas, of the Royal Navy, was killed in battle; Anne married Lawrence Washington, and was the first mistress of Mount Vernon; and Sarah married John Carlyle, of Alexandria, Va., who was a major and commissary in the French and Indian war. Mr. Fairfax married, January 18, 1731, Deborah Clarke, of Salem, Mass. Her first child was Bryan, 8th Lord Fairfax, born at Salem 1732, but better known as the Rev. Bryan Fairfax, who died in 1802. In 1734 Wm. Fairfax accepted an offer, he had before declined, to remove to Virginia and act as agent for his cousin, Lord Thomas Fairfax, in the management of the vast Fairfax land estate. He at first took up his residence in Westmoreland county and remained there for several years, but afterward improved the plantation, built "Belvoir" mansion, six miles below "Mount Vernon," and removed to it. He was residing there in 1739, when Lord Fairfax first visited Virginia and made it his home for a year. Wm. Fairfax, from his high character and acquaintance with business, soon came to the front among the leading men in Virginia. Besides being agent for his cousin, he served in the assembly of Virginia, and after the death of John Blair was president of the Provincial council and collector of his majesty's customs for the South Potomac. His second wife bore him two children, besides Bryan
[69]
already mentioned, William Henry, killed at the storming of Quebec in 1759; and Hannah, who married Warner Washington, cousin to George Washington. William Fairfax was a man of great executive ability and much beloved by the community. He died September 3, 1757. His wife survived him but a few years. "Belvoir" was left to George W. Fairfax and was his residence until he went to England in 1773.

[63]
The razor in colonial days was an essential part of a gentleman's toilet outfit. Washington had a strong beard and was early called upon to use his razor. Long, full beards were not then in fashion in America. It is a notable fact that there is not a portrait extant of an American-born patriot or statesman of the Revolutionary period, painted with a full beard. This memorandum, although not dated, is believed to have been written in 1748. The clean shaven face was constrained by the fashion of the continent; and prevailed as the custom in England and France for a period of quite 75 years.

A kind of shirt collar.
[66]
Neck Cloths.—These were usually made of fine white cambric, folded wide, were wrapped twice around the neck and worn without collars.
[67]
Caps.—The number here will attract attention considering the list of other articles; but it must be remembered that it was the custom at that period for both men and women to wear caps at night in bed. At the time when this journal was written,
[70]
bed rooms were not heated, hence the custom of warming beds before retiring in winter, and the necessity for wearing night caps is more apparent, and, further, the head was frequently shaven and wigs were worn during the day by many. It is the tradition that Patrick Henry wore at home, in the day, even, when not in full dress, a "tarred cotton cap," whilst in public he wore a wig. In speaking, when he was earnestly moved, a striking emphasis of his is said to have been a rapid whirling of his wig around his head.

At this point in the journal several blank pages occur.

The poetical effusions of George Washington are neither numerous nor notable. The specimens here given are found on the spare pages of his memoranda mixed in with his notes of surveys. Some leaves are missing at this point and the concluding lines of one poem, at least, are lost.

Land warrants were granted by the Crown, by the Legislature or its authorized agent, and by the governors of the provinces. A warrant had the character of a commission and guaranteed title. Land warrants issued in accordance with law were negotiable, and when laid and the survey plotted by a licensed surveyor and recorded in the land office, were maintained by the courts as against all other claimants. 
The following is an exact copy of an order from G. W. Fairfax, agent of Lord Fairfax, for the sale of unseated lands in the "Northern Neck of Virginia" to George Washington a licensed surveyor in Virginia as his warrant to survey a particular parcel of land. The original document was in the possession of J. A. Russell, Esq., of New York city, in 1869, and is published in the Historical Magazine for March of that year, p. 197:— 
"To Mr. G. Washington 
"Whereas, Barthalamore Anderson, of Frederick County hath Informed that there are about Four hundred 50 Acres of Waste and Ungranted Land in the said County, formerly granted to Thomas Morgan by Jost Hite as p. Bond for the same &amp; by Assignment to the sd Anderson, on Arnold's Run a branch of Shenandoah. 
"And Desiring a Warrant to survey the same in order to obtain a Deed, being ready to Pay the Composition and Office Charges. 
"These are therefore to Empower You the sd G. Washington to survey the sd Waste Land. 
"Provided this be the first Warrant that hath Issued for the same and you are to make a just, true and Acurate survey

Lost River.—This stream gets its name from the fact that for three miles it passes out of sight under a mountain which lies across its course. It rises in Hardy county, W. Va., and flows in a north-easterly direction to the Cacapehon river. The following diagram is made from a pen drawing by Washington in his field note book, but not definitely related to this particular survey.

Here terminates the entries in the little note book, containing "My Journey Over the Mountains." It is proper to state that the journal was kept in a small, vellum-bound, blank book, 6 by 3¾ inches in size, closely written on both sides of the leaf. Either from a desire to classify his memoranda, or for want of a second book, or from some motive of economy, he turned the book around and began from the other end to keep a record more particularly relating to his surveys and miscellaneous affairs. His field notes of surveys were kept in a book of the same size as the one described, from which the most of the following surveys are taken. The other surveys are found on loose sheets which have been bound and denominated miscellaneous papers; a few of them having dates, enables the editor to place them in chronological order.

For this survey Washington received the sum of £2 3s 0d on the 25th of July, 1749, as shown by entry in his cash book; a copy of which is in the Toner Collection, Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.
[76]
Culpeper county, Virginia, was formed by act of assembly in 1748, and named in honor of Lord Thomas Culpeper, governor of Virginia from 1682 to 1686. The old family name was spelled with two p's, but in using the name as a locality one p is dropped. Its original form, however, was Colepeper. The widow of Lord Culpeper spelled her name and wrote it, "Mar. Culpeper—Leeds Castle, Dec. 19, 1706." Lord Culpeper and Lord Arlington had obtained from Charles II in 1672 a grant of proprietary rights over the whole of Virginia, but within a short time, in consequence of resistance by the colonists, surrendered all except quit rents and escheats, and a duty of three half-pence per pound on tobacco. Two years after ceasing to be governor, Lord Culpeper, who had become by purchase sole owner of the grant, further abandoned all his rights except that of property in the lands of that part of the Northern Neck beyond the Blue Ridge, with an annual pension of £600 for twenty years in lieu of what he gave up. This estate of about 5,700,000 acres of land in the Shenandoah valley and the mountains beyond, went to his daughter and heiress, Catherine, who became the wife of Thomas, the 5th Lord Fairfax, and from her to their son Thomas the 6th, and the first American Lord Fairfax of Washington's time. Lord Culpeper had been one of the commissioners of plantations under Charles II, and was a man of ability for business and public affairs, although rapacious; and, as governor, wholly British, without that sympathy for Virginia interest, such as Berkeley, with all his faults, had shown. The county of Culpeper, however, was conspicuous for the patriotism of its inhabitants during the Revolution. Her "minute men," Randolph said on the floor of the United States Senate, "were raised in a minute, armed in a minute, marched in a minute, fought in a minute, and vanquished in a minute." The motto on their flag was, "The Culpeper Minute Men," along the top border; in the center a curled rattlesnake with head erect and rattling tail; on either side the words "Liberty—or Death;" and beneath, along the lower border, "Don't
[78]
Tread on Me." In the clerk's office of Culpeper court house is recorded the following: "20 July, 1749 [O. S.] George Washington, Gent., produced a commission from the President and Master of William and Mary College, appointing him to be surveyor of this county, which was read, and thereupon he took the usual oaths," etc.
[77]
Washington, S. C. C.—This is supposed to be an official check mark signature of George Washington as a licensed surveyor of Culpeper county. The plat of this survey is published by Sparks, vol. 1, p. 14, and is reproduced here, as the editor has failed, so far, in finding the original among any of the Washington papers extant. The plat bears date two days after he filed his certificate and took the necessary oath before the court in Culpeper county referred to in the preceding note.

Augusta county, and also Frederick county, were formed in 1738, out of Orange county which, prior to that date, had embraced all of Virginia beyond the Blue Ridge. The bounds of Frederick were defined as follows: the Potomac on the north, the Blue Ridge on the east, and on the south and west a line drawn from the head spring of the Hedgman creek to the head spring of the Potomac; all beyond this line, comprising the immense western territory belonging to Virginia, constituted Augusta county. The earliest Frederick county court was held at Winchester, Nov. 11, 1743; and that of Augusta county was held at Beverley's Mill Place, now Staunton, Dec. 9, 1745.
[79]

One of the natural curiosities of West Virginia is "Caudy's Castle," named presumably for this individual, who, Kercheval says, had taken refuge from the Indians on the summit of a stupendous detached rock standing out from a precipitous mountain side and having an elevation of several hundred feet. It is situated a couple of miles above the forks of Capon.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

            <Text>Jeffry Biggs is Ephraim’s Loyalist brother, who only wants to grow his legal business by moving to the edge of society. His goal is to be left alone and stay neutral, but is confronted with his brother’s need for help. He realizes that he can be involved without taking sides, if only to save his brother.
Story: Jeff is a small-town lawyer who prefers the outskirts of society where there is less competition. His brother shows up on the run and he grudgingly helps not fully aware of the crime. When Mortimer seeks to find Ephraim he choses to remain mute. When Ephraim is captured, Jeffry goes to defend him only to realize the trial was unfairly rigged (maybe Ephraim did not kill the officer?) and that all that remains is for Ephraim to be hanged. When Pontiac’s siege of Ft. Pitt is known, he persuades Ephraim to surrender the weapons to the authorities on promise of clemency.</Text>

British North America
Prior to about 1760, north of Spanish Florida, the Appalachian Divide represented the boundary between British and French colonial possessions in North America. After the French &amp; Indian War, England sought to clarify the boundaries. Under the British North America Act of 1771, the Original Thirteen colonies were re-organized into six provinces. Each of the sections below discusses each province in a bit more detail.
When debating whether to let the colonies have representation, many feared that Americans would eventually outnumber the home country. The solution hit upon manipulated the colonial borders in an effort to create division within each colony. This is the similar solution employed IRL.
We group the historic Thirteen Colonies before introducing new territories carved out of the lands acquired from the French.
Canada
Canada encompasses all land North of the St. Lawrence, which includes the Hudson Bay area and Quebec (both separated by the Laurentian Divide). Also added is Prince Edward Island. Areas South of the St. Lawrence were ceded to New England.
The Quebecois were disenfranchised by the Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769 for nearly two generations.
Carolina
The colonies of North and South Carolina were consolidated into the Province of Carolina. The boundary with George is the Savannah River with the two tributaries of the Savannah, the Tugaloo River and the Chattooga River, form the northernmost part of the border; consistent with the Original Timeline. The Northern border is along the 36°30’ as identified by King Charles II, and runs to the Appalachian Divide; consistent with the Original Timeline. Virginia Places. Virginia-North Carolina Boundary. Ref 2019.
Charlotina (Ohio)
Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Charlotina was established as a Crown colony encompassing the OTL US Northwest Territory boundaries. The argument and name emerged in a 1764 Scottish pamphlet entitled The Expediency of Securing our American Colonies by Settling the Country Adjoining the River Mississippi, and the Country upon the Ohio, Considered. Wikipedia. Charlotina. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotina. Calving Charlotina from existing colonies provided the Crown with a way of managing Indian relations and generating revenue. While land in Charlotina was given to Seven Year’s War veterans as OTL, the Crown sought a more active role in assigning the land. Washington managed to make himself the Royal Surveyor, which allowed him to exploit land grants as he sought to do OTL. Washington instituted the Township survey method instead of the traditional metes &amp; bounds method. The Temple is in Charlotina, making its history relevant.
Boundaries. Charlotina included the region lying west of the Maumee and Wabash rivers; north of the Ohio River; east of the upper Mississippi River; and south of the Great Lakes. These boundaries would include portions of modern-day Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and the entirety of Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Charlotina will later include the modern-day cities of Chicago, Milwaukee, Toledo, Detroit, Fort Wayne, and parts of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The Charlotina-Pennsylvanian border starts from the Easternmost end of Lake Erie, heading down a True South line until that line intersects the Allegheny River (near OTL intersection of I-86 and Rt-280/Quaker Run Road). It then follows the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh. The Charlotina-Mississippian border starts at the intersection of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at Pittsburgh and continues along the Ohio where Charlotina is on the northern bank and Mississippi is on the southern bank. The Charlotina-Canadian border follows the middle point of the Great Lakes…
Georgia
The colony of Georgia became the Province of Georgia. When Florida is later incorporated, Georgia extends South to capture the entire peninsula. The boundary with Mississippi is separated by the Chattahoochee River with Mississippi encompassing all land West until the Chattahoochee head water, then the shortest-route to Carolina. Its border with Carolina is consistent with its Original Timeline border with South Carolina.
Mississippi
Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Mississippi was established as a Crown colony encompassing the unsettled region south of the Ohio river down to the Gulf of Mexico, West of the Mississippi and East of the Continental Divide. Essentially, this is the south-of-Ohio Mississippi watershed.
Mississippi will later include the modern-day cities of (TN) Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Clarksville, Murfreesboro, (MS) Jackson, (AL) Huntsville, (KY) Louisville, and Lexington. Atlanta &amp; Tallahassee are on the Georgia side of the Mississippi-Georgia border.
Mississippi developed slower than Charlotina due to a less benign climate and native population, until similar temples were discovered in its hinterlands. A strong military tradition started in Mississippi after the British government gave land grants to officer and enlisted veterans of the Seven Year’s War. Similar grants were given in subsequent wars.
Boundaries. The Mississippi-Pennsylvania border follows the Monongahela River from Pittsburgh until it hits the Pennsylvania-Virginia border line (West Virginia, IRL) just south of Point Marion. The Mississippi-Virginia border follows the Mason-Dixon line East from where the Mississippi-Pennsylvania line intersect it until it intersects the Northern Branch Potomac River, north of Cumberland, VA. From there it follows the IRL boundary between Maryland and Virginia until reaches the Potomac head waters at 39°14′15″N 79°29′8″W. The Mississippi-Carolina border… The boundary with Georgia &amp; Carolina is separated by the Chattahoochee River with Mississippi encompassing all land West until the Chattahoochee head water, then the shortest-route to Carolina. OTL: The Mississippi colony our US Southwest Territory boundaries that later includes portions of our modern-day Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and West Virginia. 
New England
The colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Hampshire were consolidated into the Province of New England. This included all land South of the St. Lawrence, which extends to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and parts of Quebec. All land east of the Hudson becomes New England as well, except for Manhattan and Long Island. This led to considerable resistance by the Sons of Liberty, and led a small rebellion put down by Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania
The colonies of New York (West of the Hudson, Manhattan, &amp; Long Island), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are consolidated into the Province of Pennsylvania. The Western border was fixed with Charlotina where Pennsylvania remain East of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers and Charlotina is to the West. A true North-South line is drawn from the easternmost end of Lake Erie to the Allegheny River. Pennsylvania divided their Provincial Assembly seats equally among the former colonies. There is friction as Manhattan &amp; Long Island seek to be independent.
Virginia
The colonies of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia were consolidated into the Province of Virginia, creating religious friction between Anglicans and Catholics. The boundary with Pennsylvania was finalized by the Mason Dixon survey; consistent with the Original Timeline. The boundary with Carolina was likewise finalized along the 36°30’ parallel; consistent with the Original Timeline. The Western border with Mississippi and Charlotina by the Atlantic &amp; Mississippi Watersheds described by the Appalachian Divide. Virginia encompasses all parts of West Virginia and Virginia that flow into the Atlantic. Mississippi and Charlotina encompass those parts of West Virginia and Virginia that flow into the Mississippi.
Elysion System
Elysol is a binary system comprising Elysol Senior (G2V, primary) and Elysol Junior (KV5, companion). They orbit one another with a periodicity of roughly 79 solar years, where Senior’s circular diameter to viewers on Elysion from 1’ to 3’ wide in the sky. Junior appears 5% closer than the Sun from the Earth. See the TV Tropes article on planets. TV Trope. Useful Notes/Planets. https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Planets.

Creating a book series “bible” using Scrivener, Scapple, and Aeon Timeline
Posted in Just for Writers
Introduction

Puzzled writer – where did I first mention his broccoli phobia?
[UPDATED 9/19/2014 to reflect comments &amp; suggestions from Scrivener support.]

A recent discussion on a Scrivener Facebook group put me together with another systems engineer type (Ronnie Darby), and the two of us had a long Q&amp;A about the process mechanics of creating a book series bible based on Scrivener but utilizing the strengths of Scapple as well as Aeon Timeline. Ronnie was already doing this, and I bounced off his concepts to create a process for my own work.

A series “bible”, for those not familiar with the term, is a reference document that contains everything about a series (book or TV) except for the actual text/content. Think of it as meta-content.

For readers who don't know all of these tools, here's a very quick summary.

Scrivener is considered by many to be the premiere tool for writers. It provides a platform for not just book content, but also for research materials, character templates, and a whole lot more.
Scapple is a freeform note-creation tool, by the same folks who created Scrivener. People use it to create, for example, maps of character relationships.
Aeon Timeline is a product that allows you to lay out events, subplot arcs, characters, etc., along a timeline grid. It's used for various scheduling activities but also for organizing the timeline of  narrative works.
Each of these products is reasonably priced, with an extensive uncrippled free trial period. They run on both Mac and Windows.

For the purposes of this post, I will assume you have some familiarity with Scrivener.  There are other products that do much of what Scapple does, and there are other timeline products, but these are the best I've found for supporting narrative writing.  The principles and structure I lay out here are suitable for other tools used in conjunction with Scrivener.

I am running on Windows, and my discussions of file structures will therefore be a bit different than for Mac users.

Basic Assumptions
The primary goal is to facilitate finding what was said or described in other books in the series, combined with the ability to brainstorm as part of the creative process, in order to achieve consistency among the books in the series and to save time researching past work.  To that end, it is useful to separate the written words of the books produced (content) from the supporting material (meta-content).

The process described below assumes you will:

Use a Scrivener Project for each Book in the Series that contains only the book content, e.g., Scenes and Chapters.
Use a Scrivener Project Bible for the Series that contains everything else, for the entire series (Character templates, Research, etc.)
Use Scapple to create &amp; maintain networked Character (and other entity) relationships.
Use Scapple to brainstorm character relationships and important events.
Use Aeon Timeline to keep track of important events.
Important note about file folder structures (Windows).

Scrivener maintains its material for a project in a folder whose natural extension is SCRIV (the “.SCRIV” is not always visible). Within that folder are some project folders, such as FILES, SETTINGS, SNAPSHOTS, (which have their own subdirectories) and the master file for the project, whose natural extension is SCRIVX.

Scrivener warns that the structures within the SCRIV folder and lower are under software control and not a safe area to store other material. On the one hand, you would like to add folders for /Scapple or /AeonTimeline files and have them backed up with Scrivener's mechanisms. On the other hand, even if those folders are local to the SCRIVX file, any links between the Scrivener project and, say, a Scapple file are absolute path links, which means if they are moved or a folder name is changed, those links will break. Since storing the files locally doesn't help with that problem, I recommend a directory (folder) structure like this, to stay out of Scrivener's way but still keep all the files together:

C:/…/…/Series A (top level of everything associated with the series)
C:/…/…/Series A/Scapple (for Scapple files)
C:/…/…/Series A/AeonTimeline (for Aeon Timeline files)
C:/…/…/Series A/whatever (for other files from other applications, e.g., photos, research)
C:/…/…/Series A/Bible(.scriv) (Top level Scrivener folder for the series bible)
C:/…/…/Series A/Book 1(.scriv) (Top level Scrivener folder for the 1st book in the series
C:/…/…/Series A/Book 2(.scriv) (Top level Scrivener folder for the 2nd book in the series, etc.

Each SCRIV folder has special backups from Scrivener. The C:/…/…/Series A/ folder and its contents should be backed up like any computer file.

Scrivener – Story Bible for the entire series
Start by creating the Story Bible as a Scrivener project.  This project will contain everything except manuscript material.

Exception: if you maintain an index of names, you may want to store the master (maximum length version with all names) here in the Manuscript area, with a separate cut down version for each series book.  The latter can be incorporated into the actual manuscript at publication time. I like to copy the master version for each new book in the series, change the color of all of its content, and then, as each character is mentioned in the current work, change the color back to black (or add new names to the current list and the master one). At the end, I can easily eliminate any series characters not mentioned in the particular book because they will still be colored.

The primary content will be character templates, templates for other entities (place, setting, objects, etc.), and various research materials.

Scapple – Character (Entity) Relationship canvas for the entire series
Think of Scapple as providing a large canvas. In one place, you list a character's name. You connect him to a series of notes about his background. You connect him to another series of notes about his relationships with his mother.  You connect him to a series of notes about his girlfriend, etc.  A little ways off, you list his girlfriend's name.  You connect her to a series of notes about her ex-boyfriend, and so forth.  Each of these clusters of notes is typically connected to a central note identifying the character that acts like an anchor or hub to a spoked wheel.

As you might imagine, a character's relationships change over time. A note might say “Hated broccoli (book 1) but began to waver when his girlfriend insisted he try again (book 3)”.  When you want to reference the character's attitude to broccoli in book 5, you would want to be able to find not only your note about it (in Scapple) but also the actual words in your books (in Scrivener).

Other entities can populate the canvas.  The “grand hall in Fantasy Town” is owned by some character's uncle (relationship).  You noted that it has a fireplace (book 2) but what material was the fireback? The actual words you used in the book would be handy.

With Scapple you can search and zoom in on any of these note clusters. The devil is in the details (of course).

To begin with, your character might be named “Tom”.  A search on “Tom” in Scapple would turn up entries all over the place as he appears in various relationships, not to mention “tommy-guns” and “tomtoms”.  What you usually want, instead, is the anchor or hub where most of those references link.

In the Scrivener Story Bible, you have a character document for Tom. Only the very basic information belongs there, since all the rich detail will be in Scapple.  How to connect the two?

In Scrivener, create a custom metadata field for the character document.  We'll call that a “tag”.  It will operate like a keyword across projects (not like Scrivener's “keywords” which are restricted to the project). To remind us that it's like a hashtag, I adopt the convention of putting a hashmark (#) at the start.  So, the #tag for Tom's character document is “#tom”.  Custom metadata can be viewed both in the Scrivener Inspector and in the Scrivener Outliner, as a custom column.

Over in Scapple, add “#tom” to the note that serves as an anchor or hub for Tom in his relationship network. Now, when you search on “#tom” in Scapple, you are taken directly to the center of Tom's network of notes.  If you want to create a link back to the character document in Scrivener for Tom, you can add a link to the “#tom” note in Scapple and point to Scrivener (see next section for how to do that), then search the bible for #tom, which should only occur once: in the custom metadata for the character document.

Note that if you have a character named “Tom” and one named “Tomas”, you will want #tags that are unique enough that searching on #tom doesn't find the #tomas anchor, too.

If you have a series with a large cast, you might want to divide the Scapple file into two, where one contains all the bit parts and walk-ons, while the other has the rest of the entities, to cut down on the clutter.  If you do that, you might want an external link to the appropriate Scapple file in the Scrivener Document Reference for each entity document in Scrivener, to point you at the right canvas.

Scrivener – Project for each series book
Make a Scrivener project for each series book.  When you create the Scrivener project for each series book, you will only use the Manuscript portion of the project.  Everything else goes into the Story Bible (ideally).

What about the words Tom used to talk about his troubled relationship with broccoli in series book 2? You would like the broccoli notes to link to the words in the Scrivener scenes. Ideally, you'd like to mark the text within the scene using an annotation (a note or comment, not an inline annotation, because this is a long-term mark) and point to that. What could be easier? (NOT!)

In the Mac version of Scrivener (but not yet in Windows) you can get an absolute path link to the Scrivener scene document, but that suffers from a dependency on an absolute path which makes for a non-robust link. The front of the path is a variable (good), but the rest is absolute from there, and thus brittle.  Example: x-scrivener-item:///Users/lnlsupport/Outbox/sample_project.scriv?id=4

Meanwhile, in Windows, it's possible to identify the underlying RTF file that Scrivener stores each scene in and to link to that, but that has many issues. First, it's a nuisance to figure out which file it is.  Second, Scrivener warns that the structures are subject to change. Third, such a link would require an absolute path identifier, which would be at risk of breaking when folders are moved.

A better solution is to:

Select the text you want to get to in Scrivener, and add a Comment (aka Note) using the Comments &amp; Footnotes part of the Inspector. The default comment-name inside the comment is your username and a timestamp.  Example: KarenMyers, 9/19/2014 11:09:36 AM
Modify that comment-name to contain the entity tag #tom and the series book id #book1, and leave the timestamp alone.  Example: #tom #book1 9/19/2014 11:03:01 AM.  The timestamp portion ensures that the particular comment-name is, to all intents and purposes, unique.
In Scapple, go to the text in the note where you want the link.  Paste in the comment name (e.g., #tom #book1 9/19/2014 11:03:01 AM) and use Edit/Add Link to add the link…
Here's where it gets tricky. What are you going to link to?  We've already established that absolute paths are brittle, but absolute paths are all we can use. So we want to use the least-brittle absolute paths we can.  I don't want to link to a particular Scrivener project, because the folders where they live might move around (what if I swap to a different drive letter, for example?).

I don't want to link directly to Scrivener.exe either, since we're in the middle of the migration from 32-bit to 64-bit, and Windows has decided to use peculiar directory names for that.  On my computer, Scrivener lives here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Scrivener\Scrivener.exe.  Later on, it might live in a 64-bit program directory. I can tell that's not going to be robust as an absolute pathname.

So, what's left? I can link to a shortcut. My desktop shortcuts on Windows today live here: C:\Users\KarenMyers\Desktop\Scrivener.lnk .  That's not entirely robust — Windows could do a once-per-decade major change in how it stores user information, but I'll live in the belief that it's pretty long-term.  If Scrivener.exe changes location, all I would need to do is update the shortcut on the desktop to point there. And what's the worst that can happen? The links might break, but with the #tom tag and the #book1 tag, the information is still recoverable (I know where to look), the comment name will still work as a search text inside Scrivener, and the links could be easily recreated if necessary.

Continuing the bullets from above…

In Scapple, add the link to a shortcut invoking Scrivener (from the shortcut's properties menu).  Example: C:\Users\KarenMyers\Desktop\Scrivener.lnk.
To execute the link from Scapple, double-click on it to select it and copy the text, move until the cursor changes to a pointing finger, then click to execute the link. That will open Scrivener (if not already open) wherever you happen to have left off, which may not be the Scrivener project you want.
Use Scrivener's project menu to open the project represented by the series book id tag (#book1), and paste in the comment name from the Scapple file that you copied. Scrivener's Search bar will find it (use Search All Documents).
Aeon Timeline – Timeline for the entire series
Your books in the series cover a period of time, but their world extends far beyond that.  Your characters and their referenced ancestors have birth and death dates, events in the distant past effect current events, and alibis may require intricate timing.  A timeline program collects both Events (which have a date) and Characters (who are sometimes related to Events: the birth of a character is an event, and so is the day he embraced broccoli when the villain choked to death on it, just in the nick of time).

Your world history, even if you never refer to it with date precision, will benefit from being plotted against a timeline.

Not all timeline events are scenes in a particular book (e.g., the birth of a character prior to series start).  Not all Scrivener scenes are events important enough for a timeline (e.g., they kissed and made up). But there are many important events that are both Scrivener scenes and timeline entries.  Some events have multiple scenes (two different points of view, or talking about it in two different series books).  Some scenes have multiple events (e.g., he won the battle, killed the king, and married the alien.)

Aeon Timeline lets you store #tags with characters or events, and you can use external references, too.  The same considerations about links apply as for Scapple.  Either you will want to link to some specific text, or to an entire scene.  If the latter, just create one more comment for the start of the scene, and add whatever additional info you think might be helpful.  If you wanted to know what different characters said about the same event, you might be grateful that there are tags for that event, and live links, to the different scenes in different books.

Brainstorming in Scapple
There are a great many ways to brainstorm in products like Scapple.  For the process I've outlined, tailored to my work habits, I've made some assumptions. Your mileage may vary.

For characters, I don't just brainstorm about them before I start writing. I want that brainstorming to become “real” as the work solidifies, so that it can serve as a permanent reference over time.  Hence the character docs in Scrivener contain only very basic data — all the real material is in Scapple, with note clusters for each character that include “back story”, “description”, etc.

On the other hand, I treat events while brainstorming quite differently. I don't look upon those as permanent at all. I think of them as fodder for scene outlines in Scrivener, soon outmoded and modified. The yellow on the diagram above indicates areas where I don't think any #tag or linking formalism is really needed. But if you feel differently, you can treat events in Scapple just like characters (entities), with #tags, live links to Scrivener, and so forth.

I think that it’s only proper that I point out that my own creation and use of a Story Bible was not my idea. The Story Bible has been used for some time by screenwriters, especially of TV series. What sparked my own creation and use of one was a blog post by David Hewson. http://bit.ly/1xaGNi3

Karen Myers
No, of course not. We’re all familiar with the concept (I assume) from decades of series writing, both for books and TV.

I saw that Hewson article, but it was the specificity of our discussion, what with links to external files, custom metadata, etc., that made it all actionable for me.

David Hewson makes a very good point in his Pingback. The approach described here is quite complex, and that complexity carries the risk of a too difficult to follow story. I’ve experienced this myself. One must be very careful to avoid the behind-the-scenes complexity from spilling over into the story. This is particularly true when creating a long series, resulting in a difficult to follow story. Personally, my story bible for a series is extensive, with an elaborate back story and important character relationships. The thing is, though, that perhaps only five or ten percent of that material ends up being explicitly incorporated into the story. It gets incorporated into the writer’s mind. It comes out in subtle ways with only a few, but important words in the right places. It comes out by the much simpler story being consistent (that’s a biggie). Again, this is a very difficult thing for the writer, that the reader never notices as long as the writer has devised a means to ensure consistency. However, you can lay down money that if the writer fails to get the story consistent, the reader will pick it up, and come to a confused screeching halt. There is an incredible amount of work that a writer does behind the scenes in order to produce a good book or series of books.

I feel it to be important to follow up my previous comment with a bit of elaboration regarding character relationships. I am working with a series, at the moment (actually years), that has a cast of hundreds of characters that can be thought of as being members of a network of characters and events. That is, characters know, and interact with other characters. They know of, but don’t interact with other characters. Those relationships not only can, but usually are important within the story. They show up in the pros in subtle ways, such as when character 1 asks character 2 if character 2’s friends grandmother has recovered from her surgery. Character 1 is scheduled for the same type of surgery, so remembers that character 2 made a comment about his friend’s grandmother. It’s such things as this that make for a rich story.

Regarding the absolute paths I have another idea that could by useful (did not yet try it myself). In Windows you can use the “subst” command (or “net use” for network drives) to map a drive letter to a directory.
So, for example, you could map drive A: to C:/…/…/Series A by using:
subst a: C:\…\…\Series A

To automatically do that after booting, just copy it to a batch file and add that one to the autostart folder.

This comes pretty close to a relative path in my opinion.
If you move your working directory, You just have to change your A: mapping.

Well, now, that’s an interesting idea. I’d be fine as long as I didn’t have more than, say, 15 series (running out of available letters). I’ll have to give that some thought.

Gotta admit, I’ve lightened up on the whole Aeon Timeline approach. The product is fine, but I’m writing quickly enough now as a pantser that I begrudge the time to fill it in for limited utility.

I rely on a Scrivener series bible for most of the persistent info I want to refer to, but if I can get a book out in 2-3 months, my short term memory is getting the job done for me within an individual book, and there’s not that much I need to track across books, depending on the type of series (e.g., trilogy/ tetrology vs detective-style series).

I’m just in the process of finally writing the series example above (book 1 of The Affinities of Magic) which was delayed for another series, so by the time I get a few books done in the series, who knows — might change my mind again. 🙂

Most of the mounds in the Mississippi &amp; Ohio valleys show evidence of having had things removed, with a few scraps. One mound was left oddly intact, known in our timeline as the Toltec Mound (34°38’49“N 92°3’55”W) built by the Plum Bayou culture. The Toltec Mound site provided the trove of advanced knowledge and technology that drives this series. This trove was discovered by Ephraim George Biggs on 30 November 1782.
City of Cahokia East of modern St. Louis was inhabited to 1400, then uninhabited until about 1450 or 1550 until around 1700.

            <Title>La Resistance</Title>
            <Text>La Resistance
♫ “One day to a new beginning Raise the flag of freedom high!” ♫
Wherever The Empire is, you’ll always find La Résistance: A Ragtag Bunch of Misfits using The Power of Love and Friendship to fight against a tyrannical rule, often to help put the Government in Exile back into power. Always underdogs, they fight using guerrilla warfare and by raising the rabble of the people by revealing unpleasant truths about The Empire they’ve been trying to hide, causing the oppressed peoples to shake off the yokes of their tyrant rulers. Usually led by a Rebel Leader and armed via Vehicular Turnabout. Expect them to be opposed by Les Collaborateurs.
Almost inevitably, The Hero will join La Resistance while the battle is already underway, and will grow to become a great champion in the fight against The Empire. After all, Hollywood usually romanticizes resistance fighters, for three reasons. The first is rooted in America’s origins as rebels fighting the English during The American Revolution. The second is likewise World War II where the conflict between the Resistance and Nazi Germany fell, as close as it ever has, to clear divisions between right and wrong, and of course, Cool People Rebel Against Authority. In most cases in history and in Real Life, resistance movements are complex and confusing events. A common mistake is to confuse resistance movements with revolutionary movements, when this is not always the case. Some resistance movements are revolutionary, seeking to install a new regime to displace the old. Revolutions, needless to say, are complex, murky and at times brutal affairs. It has led in the past to the new regime forming the new government which can be as bad or worse than the old.
Of course, people rarely like having it pointed out that these groups are terrorists from the perspective of anyone who disagrees with them and Innocent Bystanders who may get caught up in the crossfire of said conflicts. This may be deliberately ironic, perhaps inviting a “we are Not So Different” moment. Or, the author might simply assume that the audience will always sympathize with rebel protagonists against The Empire, therefore moral justification of the rebellion is unnecessary and the rebels can get away with whatever is expedient. This could be averted if the Evil Empire really is evil and the rebels exercise chivalry and restraint.
Alternatively, La Resistance will be utterly incompetent and little more than an annoyance until the hero gets in there and shows them how it’s done. Sometimes their inner dissensions render them nearly unable to get anything done. Expect at least one member of La Resistance to be The Mole, or a homegrown Les Collaborateurs sabotaging their efforts from the inside. La Resistance may even be defeated without the assistance of its enemy: when the only thing uniting it is opposition to The Empire, they may end up clashing thanks to some point of ideology (generally portrayed as stupid) or method (generally portrayed as worthwhile).
Also alternatively, La Resistance may represent the last remnants of the reactionary or counter-revolutionary cronies of the old regime fighting against the Revolutionary Progressive Forces. Once re-installed, the Resistance “heroes” decide to Retcon the revolution and institute purges for the cause of revenge, and remind people why exactly they were toppled in the first place. In some cases, as it happened in some parts of World War II, the Resistance contains factions who want to restore the old regime and factions which want to bring a new regime, and these two factions might struggle during and after the war.
When La Resistance form the main ensemble of the show, or one of them, they’ll frequently exhibit a mix of characters similar to The Squad. However, they’ll usually have sneakier methods, they tend to be more morally pragmatic and ruthless than most Squads, and in series like Battlestar Galactica members becoming Shell Shocked Veterans.
Sometimes La Resistance can be downright nasty. Usually, though, even at its worst La Resistance will be the Lesser of Two Evils. If not, Grey-and-Gray Morality may be at play. In an interesting twist, if the resistance is every bit as unscrupulous as The Empire, then the hero will end up doing a bit of Conspiracy Redemption or forming a third faction. Very occasionally, La Resistance may even be the Big Bad rebelling against a peaceful government. Occasionally, La Resistance will be shown in a more comedic light, where they don’t do much besides sitting around debating theory.
Eventually, La Resistance will either die out, or grow into The Alliance as it gains power, allies, and sympathizers.
For the villainous equivalent, see The Remnant. For the opposite of La Resistance, see Les Collaborateurs. Sometimes La Resistance may not be heroes but villains, as happens in an Enemy Civil War.

### Advanced Ancient Humans

This trope is when modern-day/near-future humans discover that they actually had a super advanced society eons ago, in pre-history. In other words, *Homo sapiens* are their own [Precursors][pt2Rj4Bc]. This prehistoric civilization, for whatever reason, fell or disappeared before our recorded history began, thus explaining why nobody knew about it before.

            <Title>1764-1840: The Indian Problem</Title>
            <Text>At the end of the Seven Year's War, an estimated 4.5 million Indians lived in North America.[@calloway2007scratch] Britain was sensitive to protect its new territorial gains by not antagonizing them. In Summer 1763, Parliament debated constraining its settlers on the Atlantic side of the Appalachian continental divide as a suite of measures to establish greater control over the colonies and improve Indian relations. Discovery of advanced weaponry and their role in thwarting Pontiac's Rebellion tabled the Proclamation of 1763.

The home rule negotiation led to establishing new colonies in Indian territory. Those colonies were expected to become provinces when full British sovereignty was exerted and Englishmen were comfortable "in their hearths and homes." Americans agreed to fund British Army operations to secure settlers in those areas and accelerate this effort. They also formed local militia that operated under Army authority. Mississippi colony welcomed a higher number of British military veterans, leading to a strong military tradition in that region.

This is too American. The British would have handled it like they did India. See [@keay1995honourable]

This agreement did not sit well with the Indians, who continued to harass settlers. The 1768 Stanwix and Hard Labour treaties ceded control from some indians, but not all. War flared up in 1774 and continued through 1782.[^indian-war-1770s] The role of the French led to renewed hostilities between France and England before France was ready. This led to a hot war between the two sides from 1778 to 1783.

[^indian-war-1770s]: OTL: This is consistent with history apart from the impact on the American Revolution. British supported the indians until news in 1782 of the peace treaty. [@WesternTheaterAmerican2020]

The Ohio War of the 1780s flared up over increased white settlement, aided by French agents and a splinter group from the Sons of Liberty who thought that Ohio should become an independent nation. The Battle of Fallen Timbers of 1784 broke the back of Indian resistance. This paved the way for English settlement of southern and western Ohio.

#### Travel Times

The table below describes the constraints of space travel. Most space ships are fuel constrained based on their acceleration ability, shown by the Duration. Travel between Earth and the slipsteam is within the limits of those ships. Those with extended durations can travel four times further than regular ships, at the expense of crew comfort. Those ships could safely make it to Uranus and back, but not to the Oort cloud.

* Civilian ships have a maximum acceleration of V-shift 3.
* Military ships have a maximum acceleration of 2G (V-shift 5.
* Slipknot (5AU), Moon, Mars (1.5AU), Uranus (19AU), Oort (0.3ly) columns all refer to travel time from Earth to those (average distance) locations. Distances between planets,[^sol-distance] Oort[^oort-distance] and Belt (1AU) [^belt-distance] are estimated for the sake of simplicity.

The table below describes the travel time between Earth and the target, as provided by the Space travel calculator.[^stl-calc]

The main (or core) population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, which are based on what is known as “Kirkwood gaps”. Named after Daniel Kirkwood, who announced in 1866 the discovery of gaps in the distance of asteroids, these gaps are similar to what is seen with Saturn’s and other gas giants’ systems of rings. https://www.notion.so/1f5ce610ebbb44d68c53e3d4c847c22d

Spotlight Series: McKees Rocks Mound
April 15, 2015 by Mark McConaughy | 9 Comments


Location of McKees Rocks Mound on the bluff overlooking the mouth of Chartiers Creek with the Ohio River in the foreground. This photograph was taken in 1896 and is used courtesy of the Section of Anthropology of Carnegie Museum of Natural History. It was taken from either from a boat or Brunot’s Island in the Ohio River. The white arrow was added by the excavators. There is a train track at the base of the bluff. The author added the mound outline, dark arrow pointing to the railroad line and mound label.
McKees Rocks Mound was the largest prehistoric mound found in Western Pennsylvania.  It was 16 feet high and had a basal diameter of 85 feet.  The mound was well known in the 19th century and was located on a bluff overlooking where Chartiers Creek enters the Ohio River in the borough of McKees Rocks.

McKees Rocks Mound attracted the attention of the newly formed Carnegie Museum of Natural History and became the first site excavated by that museum in 1896 under the direction of Frank M. Gerrodette (Note: this is the correct spelling, Swauger reference below only uses one “r” in the name).  Gerrodette only excavated one half of McKees Rocks Mound in 1896.  He determined that the mound was built over time in three separate mound building episodes.  His work was prior to the development of the local prehistoric chronology and Gerrodette could only generally describe what was found.   It also was before the development of radiocarbon dating which would have provided more precise dates for the various mound construction episodes.

Examination of the materials recovered by Gerrodette by later archaeologists (see references at the end of the blog) determined the first two periods of mound building occurred during the Early Woodland period (500 B.C. to A.D. 100) by people who have been have been called Adena or Cresap phase Adena groups.  The mound was about 15 feet tall after these two building episodes.  The last or most recent period of mound building was assigned to the Middle Woodland period (A.D. 100-1000) because pottery with limestone temper typical of this period was recovered.

Gorgets placed with the important Early Woodland burials at McKees Rocks Mound. The bottom gorget was placed with the central burial in the earliest portion of the mound; while the upper gorget was placed with the central burial in the second mound stage. Photograph by the author. Collection access courtesy of the Section of Anthropology of Carnegie Museum of Natural History.
Only one burial was found in the earliest section of McKees Rocks Mound, and it was assigned to the Early Woodland period.  This burial had a gorget (an item believed to be hung around the neck that may indicate some type of rank or high position in its society), a grooved adze, one copper imitation bear canine with a piece of twined fabric adhering to it, 357 columnella shell beads made from portions of central columns from welk shells and 153 marginella (a small snail) shell beads placed with it.  The copper bear canine likely was made from a native copper nugget from the Kennesaw area of Wisconsin or the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  It may have been obtain in trade with other groups or from someone actually traveling to that area to get the copper.  The fabric adhering to it may have been from a bag that contained the imitation canine.  Similarly, the welk shells likely were obtained at the Atlantic shore either through trade or travel.  Several other items made of local cherts or bone also were recovered.

The younger or uppermost of the two Early Woodland portions of the mound contained two burials; one of which was considered to be the main burial for that construction episode.  This burial also had a gorget placed with it.  No artifacts were associated with the second burial.  Other artifacts were found in the fill of the second mound building episode.  However, they were not with the burials and accidently may have made it into the mound when the builders dug up dirt from an earlier site to use in covering the burials.
Thirty burials were found in the last portion of the mound that added the final covering bringing the height of the mound to 16 feet.  One of these burials had some pearl beads from local fresh water clams.  Three burials had pot fragments tempered allegedly with limestone that were considered Middle Woodland pottery types.
The author became interested in the materials from McKees Rock Mound when he was working on a summary of Early Woodland materials from Western Pennsylvania in the 1990s.  The collections were examined at that time in the Section of Anthropology of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.  It was found that the pottery associated with burials from the latest mound building episode was actually tempered with shell, not limestone.  Shell tempered pottery is characteristic of  the Late Woodland or Late Prehistoric period (roughly A.D. 1000-1550/European Contact) and not the Middle Woodland.

Pennsylvania Historical Mark for McKees Rocks Mound.
On May 18, 2002 a Pennsylvania Historical Marker was dedicated in a park at the base of the bluff where McKees Rocks Mound was located.  Text of the marker reads, “Largest Native American burial mound in Western PA., (16 ft. high &amp; 85 ft wide). It was hand-built by the Adena people between 200BC and 100 AD and later used by the Hopewell and Monongahela people. Late 19th C. excavations uncovered 33 skeletons and artifacts made of copper &amp; shells.”  The date for the Adena is only for a portion of the time when they may have influence people in Western Pennsylvania.  We now know the earliest dates for mounds in this region go back to almost 500 B.C.   Also, there is little good data indicating a Middle Woodland Hopewell influence on the burials at McKees Rocks Mound.

Cut bluff where rock was quarried sometime during the 20th century.
After the marker was dedicated the Seneca tribe became involved with trying to located and insure preservation of the half of the mound that was not excavated by Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 1896.  The author became involved in this search in 2008.   A group of Seneca and the author visited the bluff on August 8, 2008.  It became clear that the bluff had been modified at sometime after the excavations by Carnegie.   The bluff had been quarried for rock that was later crushed and allegedly used as aggregate for macadam used to pave the borough of McKees  Rocks.

Cement company now at the base of the quarried out bluff. Note the train tracks in front of it – these are the railroad tracks (still in use) that show up in Figure 1.
We climbed up to the top of the bluff hoping that there still might be a remnant of McKees Rocks Mound still present.  Unfortunately, whenever the stone was quarried out of the bluff it also destroyed what remained of McKees Rocks Mound.  The edge of the bluff is now used to store materials that are fed into the cement production facility at the base of the bluff.
The railroad tracks that are shown in the 1896 photograph around the base of the bluff still exist.  However, they are no longer at the base of the bluff.  The rock was quarried out as noted above.  Later a cement company built a complex at the base of the bluff.  Based on the 1896 photograph of the mound, it would have been located on top of the bluff over top of what is now the cement company.

Bluff top edge showing the storage of materials used to make cement with the conveyor belt that takes it to the mixer in the upper right.
Nothing now remains of the largest mound from Western Pennsylvania,  McKees Rocks Mound.  What we know about it is based only on the 1896 excavations by Gerrodette for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.  It is lucky that Gerrodette conducted excavations when he did, otherwise no knowledge, except the existence of the mound, would remain.  Sometime during the 20th century the mound was destroyed during quarrying work on the bluff.  The cement company developed the area after the mound was already destroyed, also in the 20th century.  Visitors to the area today can see the general area where the mound was built, but will not be able to see any of the actual mound.

            <Text>Strand is an alternate history (low-fantasy) series diverging in the 18th Century when British North America undergoes technologic acceleration caused by discovered lost technology. The British believe the technology to come from ancient aliens they named the “Toltec” or “Forefathers” after the native mounds where the technology was discovered; there are no aliens in the series. Access to advanced technology early set the British on a path to global dominance unabated in the 20th Century.
In the 18th Century, Toltec discoveries led to advanced weapons (automatic rifles). In the 19th Century, Toltec Neutrinovoltaic technology accelerated the industrial era. By the early 20th Century, Brits were in space and leveraging Toltec technology for Slipstream (faster-than-light) travel. Traveling the Slipsteam reveals “Elysion,” an inhabited earth-like planet two knots from Earth. Afraid this was the alien homeworld, the British set up on an abandoned Toltec orbital to observe Elysion, which led to Elysian anthropology.
Elysion inhabitants are humans genetically identical to Earth. Albert encounters the Hela, a dark-skinned, Indo-European-appearing ethnicity speaking what Albert determines is an older Germanic (Icelandic) language. The Hela, technologically in the Renaissance, are in the early stages of a civil war, with a rival branch of the ruling family seeking to gain power.

### Five-Man Band

Pictured: Everybody in the band.

The Five-Man Band is a group of characters whose members fall into archetypes which all complement one another. They are a very specific team with skills that contribute to the group in a way oddly analogous to the members of a rock band. It can sometimes literally be a musical group, but much more often is not.

The group traditionally includes:

- [The Leader][msRYnP7v] — *(lead singer)* The leader of the group. Can be a mastermind, charismatic, levelheaded, headstrong, or some combination of the four. Often also [The Hero][xEGOLr2Z].
- [The Lancer][bB6fIcqX] — *(lead guitar)* Usually a [contrast][Ld41ALqA] to The Leader. If the Leader is clean-cut and/or uptight, the Lancer is a grizzled [Anti-Hero][vi78sP08] or [Deadpan Snarker][YDBUsnHc]; if the Leader is driven and [somewhat amoral][vi78sP08], the Lancer is more relaxed and level-headed.
- [The Smart Guy][pgA5PZhq] — *(keyboardist)* The physically weak, but intelligent or clever member. Often nerdy and awkwardly played for comic relief. Sometimes unconventionally young (early- to mid-teens). Sometimes [The Trickster][vHGcwCml] and a buddy of the Big Guy.
- [The Big Guy][sYP1KxeK] — *(drummer)* The strongman of the team. May be dumb. Or mute.
- [The Chick][lm204qrW] — *(vocal effects, tambourine)* A peacekeeping role to balance out the other members' aggression, bringing them to a nice or at least manageable medium. The Chick is often considered [the heart][nrzSY30u] of the group. This role is played by a woman or girl. Someone female. Otherwise, it is not a Five-Man Band.

The five-man rock band phenomenon, four guys and a girl singer, is no longer as current as it once was. It was very hard to escape in the 60's and 70's. However, the group structure, as you will see in the examples, turns up in *a lot* of storytelling. Like a *whole* lot of storytelling.

See also [¡Three Amigos!][2U3D4aVg], [Power Trio][Ox3KlVqO], and [Cast Calculus][Ftq2THNh]. Fighting ability is usually determined by [Fixed Relative Strength][3RstFD4S]. Compare the [Command Roster][CuChoTZ3], for military-esque teams. [The Psycho Rangers][lu9PxRdA] are the collective [Evil Counterpart][1grFNlkm] of a given Five-Man Band. See also [Four-Temperament Ensemble][yqLCXrzE].

These are examples of teams that fit **all five** of the character tropes. Remember that they form a team dynamic; it's always tempting to match two of the characters in a show, then try to convince yourself and others that the other characters can be squeezed/wedged/stuffed into the description of the other character types, but that's not the point of the Five-Man Band trope. The individual character types exist outside of the band. **The Five-Man Band only occurs when the team as a whole fits, not just a few characters.**

As a rule of thumb, if your band example has to justify more than two types, or a single trope with more than two sentences of qualifiers, you're trying to fool yourself. If it isn't a Five-Man Band, it isn't a Five-Man Band.

### Decade Dissonance

A large-scale form of [Schizo Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech).

Every country is different thanks to culture and geography, and no two cities in any one country are alike either. However some worlds can take this to extremes, making two side by side cities as different as night and day. The differences can be purely cosmetic or go all the way to lifestyle, architecture, and even technology. You can have a [Utopia](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia) city made of [Crystal Spires and Togas](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas) sitting smack dab next to a ghetto...sorry, "quaint hamlet" that [never left](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis) [The Middle Ages](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges).

The reason, if any is given, is that there's no technology trade between the countries, so any discoveries a country makes (from Agriculture to Zoology) never leave it. Other times it's a question of societal values, where the "savage" village has chosen not to develop technology in favor of peaceful agrarian lives; however you can expect them to have copious and advanced magic if it's a [Magic Versus Science](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience) setting. It's almost never purely stylistic, like [Gotham City](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman) and [Metropolis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman). Both exist in the same year and country, but one is firmly entrenched in 1920's Gothic and Noir style, while the other is an Art Deco optimistic future.

More plausible is [Used Future](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture), where one area is able to maintain a relative level of sophistication [After](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd) or [Just Before the End](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBeforeTheEnd) where others are reduced to tent villages. In these cases, advanced technology is *known of* by most, but becomes uncommon away from the advanced areas.

Compare [Low Culture, High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech), where a backwards culture uses technology it doesn't understand. Possibly also a [Tomorrowland](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomorrowland).

            <Text>Prolog: The Iroquois under KARIWASE capture &amp; kill a trapper asleep in his camp, announcing the global threat.
Act 1 / Chapter 1. Ephraim George BIGGS is a rebel Son of Liberty on the run from HIM a UK bounty-hunter MORTIMER REECE. He shows up at his brother’s house in the rain looking for refuge, but his brother (ever the lawyer) finds out why and sends him away (he repairs Jeffry’s son’s toy, showing him as a tinkerer).
Ephriam goes to another town and gets hired as a smith who comments on his breeding, hands, and disrespect for civil authority. “I’m not fond of the color red.” Meanwhile, Reece shows up at Jeff’s house on the trail, but Jeff avoids giving up his brother; but Reece learned that Ephraim was trained as a smith. He has his men comb the countryside looking for towns with new smiths. This leads to Reece finding Ephraim under an assumed name, when a fight breaks out and Ephraim flees into the wilderness. But, Reece pursues, with Ephraim’s capture. This leads to Reece finding Ephraim under an assumed name, when a fight breaks out and Ephraim flees into the wilderness. But, Reece pursues, with Ephraim’s capture.
Chapter 2. The Iroquois under Kariwase pick up on the pursuit and hunt them, resulting in a firefight that lets Ephraim escape (shoeless). The Iroquois under Kariwase pick up on the pursuit and hunt them, resulting in a firefight that lets Ephraim escape (shoeless). Ephraim flees wounded &amp; pursued by the Iroquois, when he falls into the TEMPLE unconscious. Reece and team get split during the fog of war, with a third rejoining with Reece &amp; beating a retreat to civilization. Ephraim flees wounded &amp; pursued by the Iroquois, when he falls into the TEMPLE unconscious. Reece and team get split during the fog of war, with a third rejoining with Reece &amp; beating a retreat to civilization. When Ephraim comes to, he is able to start a small fire for light, letting him find material to dress his wound. He explores the temple and discovers the rifle ala Conan the Barbarian. He experiments with it until he accidentally fires it. His continued exploration leads him to a larger space, an artificial light (the lightening bug), and a trove of weapons and ammunition. Excited by the prospects, Ephraim decides to take a few toys to Philadelphia to the Sons of Liberty. But, he first has to escape the Iroquois party.
Act 2. / Chapter 3.
He finds a way out of the Temple, but the pursuit resumes when he gives away his position. He shoots the hunting party killing the five of them in rapid succession. Rather than run, he loots the bodies for shoes and uses their arrows to conceal the wounds. With a makeshift sled, he pulls out his samples and heads to Philadelphia, but he stops by his place in Smithytown, which alerts Mortimer that he is not dead. Meanwhile, Kariwase discovers the slain warrior party and discovers the ruse, bewildered he tracks Mortimer’s sled until he realizes it is leaving their territory. Mortimer, alerted to Ephraim’s return confronts the Smithy, but is thwarted somehow, and has his men resume searching neighboring towns while he goes back to Jeffry.
Chapter 4. Ephraim arrives in Philadelphia and quietly makes himself known to the Sons. After a meal, he arranges a rural demonstration of the rifles, but SOLOMON SHARPE reports this to WARREN BOYDELL, who sends word to Mortimer. Meanwhile, Kariwase meets with Pontiac and receives instructions related to the brewing war. Mortimer meets with Jeffry and is flustered, accusing him of harboring a fugitive (and of being a coward by not challenging a duel), but when he gets back to his room in the Inn has word from Boydell of Ephraim’s location. He hurries back to Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, Boydell traps Ephraim by having Sharpe entertain Ephraim over dinner. Meanwhile, Kariwase is involved in a battle fought before Ft. Pitt Siege.
Act 3.
In a cell (Research jails in Philadelphia circa 1770), Ephraim sends word to Jeffry asking for help. Mortimer arrives in Philadelphia and after meeting with Sharp wants to find out about the weapon. They secure the rifle and test it, with Mortimer having a thumb incident. Ephraim and Mortimer talk about the rifle, and Mortimer tries to get him drunk, only to learn that Ephraim has a high alcohol tolerance. They argue about British authority instead. “Your sentence will be carried out.” “I’ve not been tried yet.” “You were in absentia.” Meanwhile, Kariwase involved in another attack somewhere, and we find that he is up-and-coming and very anti-European. Jeffry arrives in Philadelphia and tries to find a way to help his brother; finding out that Mortimer might let Ephraim free if the Temple’s location was revealed. But, Ephraim refuses to help the British. Meanwhile, news of Pontiac’s raids reach Philadelphia, alerting to the need to take action. LOCAL COMMANDER realizes there are insufficient troops to protect the interior, when Boydell mentions the weapons. This renews pressure to divulge the location, and when confronted about the facts (which he wants to doubt but for Jeffry’s fear), Ephraim surrenders the weapon cache’s location.
Act 4.  Ephraim reacts to having given away the best thing for the Revolution when his brother cheers him up (story less). They start training on the weapons they have when they realize they do not have enough (4 rifles) or enough bullets (80). Mortimer heads to Pitt while Ephraim takes a small team to the Temple to get more, including the Strand brothers. He tries to take a route to obfuscate the temple’s location. They get to the temple, no sign of trouble, get more weapons and bullets, and head to Pitt. Meanwhile, the Seige at Pitt intensifies. Mortimer and his men get into a fight with Kariwase, who is beaten back by the four rifles. Stunned &amp; wounded, Kariwase heads to Pitt with Mortimer in pursuit. All arrive at Pitt and a fight ensues with two teams with rifles putting the indians into a cross-fire that kills most the indians. There is cleanup afterward and discussion about the rifles. Meanwhile, word gets to Boydell who sends a rifle, case of rounds and a lantern to London. Mortimer and Biggs talk, Biggs agreeing to disappear. Mortimer &amp; Boydell talk about the need to take what they have and break the Iroquois’ back, when Johnson arrives to suggest negotiation. “How can you beat back an entire nation with 16 rifles and a box of bullets?” Biggs arrives in Charleston, taking up work as a smith. He reviews a drawing what he remembered the rifle looking like. The Strand brothers retrace their steps to the Temple; grab a bunch of tech and head to Philadelphia. The technology reaches London, George “this changes everything.”</Text>

The colony of Georgia became the Province of Georgia. When Florida is later incorporated, Georgia extends South to capture the entire peninsula. The boundary with Mississippi is separated by the Chattahoochee River with Mississippi encompassing all land West until the Chattahoochee head water, then the shortest-route to Carolina. Its border with Carolina is consistent with its Original Timeline border with South Carolina.

Burnt Cabins is a historic unincorporated community in Dublin Township, Fulton County, Pennsylvania, United States, at the foot of Tuscarora Mountain. It is about 3 miles west of the Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel on I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the turnpike runs within 100 yards of the village. U.S. Route 522 also runs through the village. 
History[edit]
The land was occupied by Native American tribes until 1758, and permanent European colonization did not start until 1763, after the French and Indian War.[3] Nevertheless, by 1750, a hamlet known as Sidneyville had grown to 11 squatters cabins. The homes of these early settlers were burned by order of the provincial government to maintain the peace and to demonstrate to Native Americans that their ownership would be respected.[4] Participants in the burning included Conrad Weiser, Richard Peters, George Croghan, and Benjamin Chambers.[5] 
The next day, being the 24th of May, Mr. Weiser and Mr. Galbreth, with the Under-Sheriff and myself, on our Way to the Mouth of the Juniata, called at Andrew Lycon's, with Intent only to inform him, that his Neighbours were bound for his Appearance and immediate Removal, and to caution him not to bring himself or them into Trouble by Refusal: But he presented a loaded Gun to the Magistrates and Sheriff, said, he would shoot the first Man that dared to come nigher. On this, he was disarmed, convicted, and committed to the Custody of the Sheriff. This whole Transaction happened in the Sight of a Tribe of Indians, who by Accident had in the Night-time fixed their Tent on that Plantation; and Lycon's Behaviour giving them great Offence, the Shickcalamies [sons of Shickellamy in Peters" party] insisted on our burning the Cabbin, or they would burn it themselves; Whereupon, when every Thing was taken out of it (Andrew Lycon, all the while assisting) and Possession being delivered to me, the empty Cabbin was set on Fire by the Under-Sheriff, and then Lycon was carried to Goal [Jail].[6]
The area developed as a linear village along eighteenth century roads that led from Philadelphia across the Tuscarora and Allegheny Mountains to Pittsburgh. Burnt Cabins first developed along a pack horse trail that generally followed an earlier Indian trail. In 1755 the Forbes Road expanded the trail to get British troops and supplies in place to take Fort Duquesne. In 1771 the Three Mountains Road was opened to connect Burnt Cabins more directly to Shippensburg. However, by 1815 the Chambersburg and Ft. Bedford Turnpike was opened, bypassing both Burnt Cabins and Shippensburg from the most direct route between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Surprisingly, Burnt Cabins benefited by being bypassed by the turnpike, as the county population grew and drovers used the older, free roads to take their cattle to market.[3] 
The entire village, consisting of about 44 buildings and 50 acres, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The village's development was most influenced by the construction of the Burnt Cabins Grist Mill, which still produces flour and is listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places. 
The town received international attention in May 1966 as a chief location of an eight-day manhunt for the ex-convict kidnapper of 17-year-old Peggy Ann Bradnick. 
The 1964 book Bread-and-Butter Indian by Anne Colver is set among Pennsylvania Dutch settlers in the Burnt Cabins community. It based on true events in the life of Barbara Baum which took place there in 1783.[7] 
Burnt Cabin is in the Eastern Standard Time zone. Elevation is 889 feet. 
ZIP code information[edit]
The Burnt Cabins ZIP code 17215 covers 11.92 sq mi (30.9 km2), a population of 437 and 163 housing units, 123 of them occupied.[8][9]

Science &amp; Technology in Strand accelerates markedly from Reality, based on discovery of Toltec technology. This section delves into details of the technology, its development and introduction to society.
Power (Engines, Electricity &amp; Locomotion)
Engine development was slower as it derived from patent research. Dates below indicate when they were commercially available.
Table: Timeline of Power Technology Development
1820 Electricity using hydropower. Biomass generators commercially available by 1839 ae This is ae ===
1826 Oil discovered, knock 20 years off of evolution of oil
1828 Diesel engine (called the biomass engine)
1836 JL Chandler reverse engineered neutrino power, receiving a patent on the Chandler Power Cubes. (15 June)
1836 Gasoline engine limited use to highly urban environments due to poor infrastructure and lack of access to gas.
1839 Diesel locomotive Slow and mechanically inefficient
1842 First Neutrinovoltaic powered (NVP) locomotive using the MicroChandler Power Cube.
1845 Gasoline automobile limited utility in favor of biomass trucks.
1845 Chandler died (29 December), Chandler’s patent on the CPCs lapses in 1846.
1859 First Neutrinovoltaic powered (NVP) automobile by Tucker. Wikipedia. History of Electric Vehicle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_electric_vehicle#Electric_model_cars. Accessed February 20, 2020.
1861 Latimer Clark and Sir Charles Bright coined the name “volt” for the unit of resistance. This countered the growing interest in naming it the “Chand” or “Chandle” as part of the resistance to Toltec influences. The term was in widespread use by 1869.
1869 NVP “Victoria” Taxies introduced by Walter C. Bersey (10y early, see Images)
1888 NVP oceangoing ships (Replacing oil-burning naval ships)
Chandler Neutrino Power Cube
Johnathan Link Chandler was the first to reverse engineer the Toltec Neutrino Engine (called Annichites by the Toltec), creating the Chandler Neutrino Power Cell, and Power Cubes. The NVPC (Neutrino-voltaic Power Cube) is a 2.25" cube. Chandler encased them in a thin layer of white porcelain with four brass electrodes flush with the body. This allows the cubes to be tethered to create the larger power cubes.

The five-stone Domestic CPC is the standard accessory of modern English domesticity (1914) at 3.1 kilowatts.
IRL HMS Dreadnought used 17MW propulsion. The HMS Dreadnought was launched with three 60-ton CPCs. The Titanic used five 60-ton CPCs.
When humanity found the Toltec orbitals, they saw just how closely Chandler’s design worked, with a single 225-ton CPC.
Eternal Lantern is a variable-output (400-800-1600 lumen, 40w, 60w, 100w equivalent) light that is powered by a half-pound 25w Neutrino Power Cube (CPC). It weighs 12 ounces, and is 3" diameter, 4" tall.

Slipstream Travel
This section discusses the application of faster-than-light (FTL) space travel.
Slipstream technology describes the ability to get from Earth to Slipstream and through Slipstream. Odyssey Limited is the Crown chartered company responsible for exploitation of Slipsteam tech and non-solar system exploration.

Space Travel
This section discusses the application of slower-than-light (STL) space travel. As IRL, Strand space travel involves use of reaction drives, though Toltec technology accelerated the development of very efficient drives.

#
Spacecraft
Design. Spacecraft are symmetrically built around a frame. Propulsion is reaction-based, so a considerable amount of the ship’s total mass is its consumable reaction material. Ships cannot travel in atmosphere as gravity will crush the frame. Travel between planet and orbitals is done through interface vehicles. Ships are built like office towers (Pringles cans), with small decks stacked on top of each other, which experience gravity only when the ship is under thrust.
Travel. When traveling, ships accelerate to the midpoint of their journey, turn around, and decelerate. No dogfights, no Immelmann or Crazy Ivan maneuvers. Safe travel means accelerating to a midpoint at 1.0-1.5 G, turn around, decelerate at 1.0-1.5 G, over a period of several days.
Maneuvering. Maneuver drives use liquid nitrogen or water heated to boiling point.
Heat. Heat is always a problem. An inability to dissipate heat can get one into trouble. Burn your engines too much, or fire too many lasers, and you start to have problems in combat yourself, because of an inability to radiate heat into the darkness of space.
Payload. These concerns combine to suggest that a ships payload section is relatively small (10-30% of the ship’s mass), Given the limits on payload, space for crew, weapons, cargo, and extras is limited. Slipdrives are small to allow FTL travel within the design constraints (i.e. we wanted ships both with slipdrives and with guns), and so the limit on FTL travel comes from the point of departure, well above the ecliptic of the system.

Weapons Development
Weapons development in the 19th Century accelerated based on access to working Toltec weapons. Toltecs continued to use slug-throwing weapons, so this accelerates the introduction of semi- and full-automatic weaponry. Based on the Neutrino discoveries, scientists speculate the Toltec withheld their more advanced weaponry from Earth.
Personal Weapons
Several weapons were found in the Toltec Indian Mound Temple. Anglo-American first reverse-engineered the actual weapon as the first generation. A second iteration led to improvements.

            <Title>Faster-than-Light Travel</Title>
            <Text>Faster-than-light travel is possible via wormholes, known as Slipstreams. IRL, wormholes are a scientific conjecture, derived from the same equations that describe black holes. We cannot conceive of how to get to or use a wormhole. In Strand, however, wormholes are a convenient means of travel from one place to another. People traverse wormholes using a Jump drive, with each wormhole connecting between only two locations. Travel time is near instantaneous for the jumping ship and its occupants.

A Slipknot is the term used by Toltecs and adopted by English (Laufknoten in German, Trou de Biche (tru-de-beesh) in French, Hueco in Spanish, Orifício in Portuguese).

            <Title>Mook dies in Burnt Cabin / Sidneyville</Title>
            <Synopsis>L.Cpl MILLER rides into the Wilderness. He is rebuffed in Fannett Township by Irish, and travels to Burnt Cabins. Whe he starts to retreat, he is ambushed and scalped by indians</Synopsis>
            <Text>Saturday, November 20, N.S 1763. Lance Corporal Miller rode uneasily toward Fannett. He was a foot soldier, unaccustomed to riding a horse. It chaffed. They had been riding since they left New Haven, so he was getting better at it. He would rather be walking. He cursed Ephraim Biggs for pulling him further away from civilization.
The town of Fannett was a ride up a narrow path through the mountains from Shippensburg. Miller knew well the area may have savages. The French may have withdrawn to focus on other parts of the world, but the savages were native to the land. They would not leave. The presence of several English settlements did nothing to alleviate his professional concern. He rode carefully, watchful for any sign of threat. He could feel their eyes on him. The journey took all day.
He arrived in Fannett as the sun had just set. Its reputation as a town was inflated. Four cabins flanked the trail. There would be no Ephraim Biggs here. The officers ordered him ask, so he would ask.
Miller dismounted and went to the more substantial of the cabins. None of them looked inviting. He pounded on the door, wishing he had his musket instead of a pistol and hatchet.
The door opened up slightly. The barrel of a musket poking through. “What do you want?” The accent was Irish.
Savages enough. The musket moderated his dislike of the Irish. “Sir, I am looking for Ephraim Biggs. He’s a preacher, or smith, or something.” He hesitated. “He’s a friend of mine.”
“You’re the only stranger in these parts.” The brough was stronger.
“Alright. No need to be alarmed. As I said, he’s a friend. He said he was coming this way.”
A harumph came from the other side of the door. “Your friend must have sent you the wrong way, Englishman.”
“Alright. I believe you.” He took a moment to assess the situation. He needed shelter through the night so he could press on the next day. “Is there somewhere for my horse and I to stay?”
“Not here. Not for you. Be off with you.”
The door slammed as the musket barrel was withdrawn. Miller breathed a sigh of relief. He tried the other cabins to see if any would accept him for the night. With each refusal, he grew more frustrated. If they knew I was a part of the regiment sent to protect them. He wanted to exercise what authority being a member of the Royal American Regiment conveyed, but suspected by their Irish accents the effort would meet with more than their current ire.
He considered his options, and remembered the clearing. He saw it right at dusk, a few furlongs back. He led the horse back to the clearing, and settled down for the night. Sleeping in the open was not novel to him, though in those times he was accompanied by several hundred men and muskets with pickets and cannon. He counted himself lucky when his unit was reassigned to New Haven. It was as far from any of their campaigns as he could have expected. He cursed this detail to hunt a fugitive as he fell asleep. He did not understand why a simple murder would result in such a manhunt. They happen with punctuality in England.
He woke the next day sore and cold. His horse grazed contently on some nearby grass. Miller made a small fire for warmth. He ate a bit of breakfast. “If I wait another day or two and head back, they will be none the wiser,” he said to the horse. “It’s not like you would report me. You like this place well enough. None of these people would report to Captain Reece either.” It was just the sort of thing he sorely wanted to do. He suspected that bastard would ask him some silly question like a description of the settlements. “Reece has that glare that read right through you. He’s a seer.”
He finished breakfast and extinguished the fire. He resaddled the horse and resumed his journey down the path. It was another climb through a mountain down a narrow path. At the bottom of the mountain he crossed a creek. A few minutes later, he stopped. There were several burnt cabins along the path. The path itself was used, but there was no sign of habitation. He looked up at the sun and judged it was barely noon.
“Well, this is the second town. If a many like Biggs came this way, I’d be surprised.” He patted his horse. “I know where you can get your supper. Let’s go back to Fannett.” He turned the horse around.
As they reached the creek, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. He recoiled from the suddenness of it and accidentally pulled on the tether. The horse reared back, dumping him onto the trail.
Miller looked at the source of pain and saw an arrow lodged in his lower right chest, just above where the ribcage starts. He screamed. He grasped at the arrow, hoping to pull it out or run. He knew he had to get away. He struggled to his feet. Without a musket’s report, he did not know where the arrow came from. While he hesitated, another arrow slammed into his chest, closer to the heart. He tried to run, but his legs lost their ability to move. A third arrow went through the breastbone and into his heart. His legs went out from under him.
He tried to get up, but none of his muscles responded. He wanted to run away, but could not. He rested his head on the path, smelling the earthiness of it. He was tired. He wanted to take a nap.
As he faded to semi-consciousness, he felt his head being grabbed and jerked. He could not see the face, but the hair was long. He presumed it was a beautiful woman cradling his head. She combed his hair with a very sharp comb.  He wanted to tell her she was being too rough, but he was too tired. He fell asleep.</Text>

            <Title>1763-1783: Point of Divergence</Title>
            <Text>From the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until the end of the Seven Year's War of 1763, a philosophical and political rift occurred both in America and Britain. Americans viewed Locke's Second Treatise of Government as a blueprint for social change. The British viewed it as wasted paper. Benign neglect from the 1720s to 1740s resulted in colonists assuming more control for their affairs; home rule _de jure_. This neglect was shattered during the Seven Year's War, but Americans exploited the crisis with their more sophisticated understanding of politics and emerged from the War debt-free and ready to assert its independence. In England, Parliament weakened the Crown's control over politics and the prerogative system, nearly reducing the Crown to a figurehead. George III subverted that trend by taking control of Parliament in the years between his coronation in 1760 and the end of the War in 1763.

Saddled with war debt and the need to protect North America, George's Parliament enacted the Sugar Act, which reduced the tax on molasses. Americans rioted and decried this as an intrusion into its home rule. The period known as the American Troubles (1763-67) were pivotal in stabilizing British-American relations and establishing the modern British Commonwealth.
During the Troubles, Crown and Parliament exploited American internecine jealousies and prejudices to prevent this strain from flaring into mutiny. George recognized the threat to stability and had Parliament invite American colonies to send delegates to negotiate. An agreement similar to the earlier home rule "Albany Plan" pitched by Benjamin Franklin in 1755 was agreed upon. The Stamp Act of 1765 &amp; Declaratory Act of 1766 never occur. Timelines diverge.[^OTL-American-Troubles]

[^OTL-American-Troubles]: OTL: The watershed period from 1763-1767 divided America and Britain. The Proclamation in 1763, the Sugar Act in 1764, Stamp Act of 1765 and its repeal / Declaratory Act of 1766 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 progressively strained and broke relations. As cold hostilities turned to hot war, moderates sought to halt the separation until by the 1777 Battle of Saratoga it became clear no reunification was possible.

Toltec weaponry thwarted Pontiac's Rebellion in Summer of 1763, which prevented the Declaratory Act from being enacted. Instead, King George sends a full regiment to ensure the Ohio is retained and negotiations for American home rule started. REMOVE

In 1765, Parliament invited a delegation from each of the mainland colonies to work out differences that included Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. This extended negotiation (1765-68) blunted Radical demands for independence. However, a splinter from the Sons of Liberty continued the (now unpopular) fight for American Independence. This splinter movement is a key area of conflict in Discovery Season.

These negotiations led to legislation that addressed British North America grievances and allowed both sides of the Atlantic to move forward in a tense harmony.

#### Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769

The Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769 extended all customary rights &amp; privileges to native-English speaking white settlers in British North America. This created some frustration with Caribbean Colonials. Many Caribbean colonists remedied this by establishing residence in Charles Town, Carolina. However, this addressed the IRL complaints of colonialists that they were not treated to the rights they would have enjoyed had they remained home.

This disenfranchised French-Canadian residents as their native language was French. Many raised their children speaking English to extend these rights to them.

#### British North America Act of 1771

British North America sought representation in Parliament. The government agreed, providing the colonies restructured. This act transformed the continental colonies to six self-regulated provinces:
Canada,
New England (some called Camelot),
Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York),
Virginia (includes Maryland &amp; Delaware),
Carolina,
&amp; Georgia.
This act further gave those provincial governments representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Charlotina province is added in 1803, encompassing IRL Northwest Territory United States. Parliament calculated this reorganization of the colonies into provinces would create internal tension that would allow England to retain control.

This created frustration among the joined colonies (NY, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island &amp; Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New Hampshire), especially RI&amp;PP as they sought to be more tolerant religiously than Massachusetts. This is an example of Parliament's intentional friction within the provinces.

#### Rights of Religious Liberty Act of 1772

British North America sought religious liberty. Parliament sought its debts to be paid and taxation for its recurring budget. Some of this budget paid Anglican ministerial salaries. This act permitted provinces to manage their own religious affairs. This effectively abolishes the Anglican church in British North America except for Virginia and Carolina. Thus liberty was a province matter, instead of individual. The lack of Anglican minsters removes British North America's obligation to pay that portion of the budget. British North America provinces are allowed to establish their own state religions.
Virginia and Carolina remained Anglican.
Canada was not allowed to have Catholics in government, but was otherwise Catholic territory.
New England became officially Congregationalist (Puritan). Though the power of puritanism lapsed a generation before, there is still enough friction between the denominations.
Pennsylvania extended its religious tolerance through New York, making it a bastion for downtrodden faiths.

#### War Debt Equity Act of 1772

In the _quid pro quo_ for the Rights of Religious Liberty Act, British North America provinces agreed to take on half of the Government's debt incurred by the end of the French &amp; Indian War. Whether this meant war debt or total debt was a matter of disagreement that was settled during the Napoleonic Era. The Seven Years' War nearly doubled Great Britain's national debt, so the question of whether British North America provinces accepted a quarter or half of the debt was no small issue. Buried in this act was the liquidation of various debts by prominent members of British North America society. This pushed the Sons of Liberty into the fringe by bribing the elite.

Fannett Township is a township in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,548 at the 2010 census.[3] The township derives its name as an older variant spelling of Fanad, County Donegal, from early Irish settlement in the area. It was formed before 1762, and until about 1795 included the area now in Metal Township.[4]

Geography[edit]
Fannett Township is the northernmost township in Franklin County. It is bordered to the west by Huntingdon County, to the north by Juniata County, to the northeast by Perry County, and to the east by Cumberland County. The township is in the Ridge and Valley Province of the Appalachian Mountains: Tuscarora Mountain forms the western boundary of the township, and the eastern boundary follows the crest of Kittatinny Mountain (known as Sherman Mountain to the northeast). 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 68.2 square miles (176.7 km2), of which 0.02 square miles (0.04 km2), or 0.02%, is water.[3] 
Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, crosses the southeastern part of the township, but with no direct access. The turnpike enters the township from the east via the Kittatinny Mountain Tunnel. 
Unincorporated communities in the township include Spring Run in the southwest, Dry Run in the west-central area, Doylesburg in the center, and Concord in the north, all along Pennsylvania Route 75. Amberson is in the eastern part of the township, in the Amberson Valley between Rising Mountain to the northwest and Kittatinny Mountain to the southeast. The southern half of the township is drained by the West Branch of Conococheague Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River, while the northern half is drained by the Narrows Branch of Tuscarora Creek, a tributary of the Juniata River and part of the Susquehanna River watershed.

            <Text>Artificial Gravity &amp; Comfort Criteria
This section written by Theodore W. Hall. Theodore Hall. SpinCalc. https://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/#aboutAccessed February 21, 2020. This information would normally be captured in my research. Lightly edited, his narration on the topic was hard to
Artificial gravity is the inertial reaction to the centripetal acceleration that acts on a body in circular motion. Artificial-gravity environments are often characterized in terms of four parameters:
•	Radius from the center of rotation.
•	Angular Velocity or “spin rate.”
•	Tangential Velocity or “rim speed.”
•	Centripetal Acceleration or “gravity level.”
In orbital habitat design decisions are between artificial gravity and microgravity. Earth gravity is not relevant. Half of all astronauts endure “space adaptation syndrome” that lasts from one to three days when they enter microgravity. Connors, Mary M.; Harrison, Albert A.; Akins, Faren R. Living Aloft: Human Requirements for Extended Spaceflight (NASA SP-483, p. 35-51). NASA Scientific and Technical Information Branch. Merz, Beverly (1986 October 17). The Body Pays a Penalty for Defying the Law of Gravity. In, Journal of the American Medical Association (vol. 256, no. 15, p. 2040-2041). American Medical Association. A similar period of adaptation to artificial gravity seems reasonable, considering the substantial health benefits that it offers versus prolonged weightlessness. It may not be necessary to provide immediate perfect “comfort” in artificial gravity, especially in small exploration-class vehicles with select crew. Deliberate architectural design for the unusual conditions of artificial gravity ought to aid adaptation and improve the habitability of the environment. Hall, Theodore W. (2006). Artificial Gravity Visualization, Empathy, and Design (AIAA 2006-7321). 2nd International Space Architecture Symposium (SAS 2006), AIAA Space 2006 Conference &amp; Exposition, San Jose, California, USA, 19-21 September 2006. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
Comfort indicators are based on the following criteria:
Radius Because centripetal acceleration – the nominal artificial gravity – is directly proportional to radius, inhabitants will experience a head-to-foot “gravity gradient”. To minimize the gradient, maximize the radius.
Angular Velocity The cross-coupling of normal head rotations with the habitat rotation can lead to dizziness and motion sickness. To minimize this cross-coupling, minimize the habitat’s angular velocity.</Text>

            <Title>Mortimer Seeks Ephraim in Shippensburg</Title>
            <Synopsis>Meanwhile, Reece shows up at Jeff's house on the trail, but Jeff avoids giving up his brother; but Reece learned that Ephraim was trained as a smith. He has his men comb the countryside looking for towns with new smiths.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Wednesday, November 10, 1762 Even with the leaves falling off the trees, Mortimer Reece thought America was beautiful. At least the middle colonies part of America. New England had its beauties, more in the inhabitants than the scenery. The Carolinas were too hot and sandy. The Quakers managed to pick the best part of America. The further away from Philadelphia they rode, the more he enjoyed the scenery.
The road widened as they entered the town. The afternoon sun just started to dip below the tops of the trees. Sharpsburg, he thought they named it. As they rode through, it looked quaint enough. Grey stone buildings in the Georgian style. They were not going anywhere. He chuckled when he saw the wooden fort. He pointed it out to Dorian Mabbott. “Sharpsburg has permanent buildings but temporary fortifications. They should be glad hostilities are at an end.”
“Shippensburg, sir.”
“What?”
“We are in Shippensburg, sir. Named for Chief Justice Shippen.” Dorian’s tone was respectful.
“Quite right. Shippens-burg.” He muttered its name a few times under his breath. “Still, he does have a beautiful wife.”
“Who, sir?”
“His Honorable Judge Shippen.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you see the church?”
“Not yet, sir. I doubt he’s in one. They’re Presbyterians out in the country. He was trained in the Puritan tradition.”
Mortimer chuckled at that. Puritans are a tradition? Hardly. “Damned separatists. The Church of England is the only civil church. God save the King.”
His men repeated in unison, “God save the king.”

“Still, I’ll buy you a pint if he’s not found in a church.”
They rode until they came to the tavern. “Widow Piper’s Tavern. Handsome structure, that. Such clean lines. I wonder who built it?” He shifted in his saddle. It had been a long ride. “Come on, let’s give it some business.”
He and his men dismounted and tied their horses. Mortimer paused a few more minutes to study the shape of the building. For an American tavern, it was not terribly large. Its size was more like the alehouses in London.
The ten of them entered the tavern. Describe interior.
TODO// Visit the Widow Piper’s Inn
The common area was just large enough for his entourage. A woman, probably Widow Piper, worked the fire by the hearth.
“Good evening, madam.”
She looked up. “How can I be of service?” The Scottish burr was distinct, unsoftened by her time in America.
“If you have lodging,” pointing his hat at his men, “we will be staying the night.”
She smiled. “Aye. No boarders today.”
“Splendid. We’ve just arrived from.” He paused an turned to Dorian.
“Harrisburg, sir.”
“Yes. Quite. Harrisburg. Hard journey. We are famished.”
“Well, you’re in luck. We have a meat pie, hasty pudding with bacon, oatmeal porridge, a dish of eggs and beer. Should be ready in an hour.”
“No ale, perhaps?” Mortimer said.
“Aye, ale beer.”
After a pint, Mortimer’s men took the horses to the nearby stable while Moritmer and Dorian remained. They were on their second pint. The prices were lower than Mortimer would have expected. It was a decent ale, even if too malty for his palette.

“Mrs. Piper. Have you recently had a visitor?”
“This is a tavern, sir. With all the travel between Philadelphia and the wilderness, we usually have several visitors. Usually redcoats or trappers. It starts to slow down about this season.”
“Anyone by the name of Ephraim Biggs?” Dorian jumped in.
Mortimer felt a little exasperated. Dorian was younger, always in haste.
“No Ephraim Biggs. There is a Jeffry Biggs here in town.”
Mortimer sat up a little. “Oh?”
“Aye. He lives just on the other side of the fort.”
Dorian continued, “has he been here long?”
“He brought his family here a couple years ago. Once the indian troubles started to quiet down a bit.”
“Pastor?”
“Oh, no. Worse. He’s a lawyer.”
“There does not seem to be much calling for the law out here.” Mortimer injected.
“You’d be surprised. He works for Judge Shippen, who owns all the land around us. Once the war is over, they’ll be selling plots of land. Mr. Biggs will be handling the surveys and sales. He usually comes in every morning for a beer and Indian pudding with the missus being with child.”

* * *

The next morning, Mortimer and Dorian sat over breakfast and waited. Mrs. Piper described Jeffry to them, so they were prepared. They did not wait long. A somewhat tall man with reddish-brown hair came into the tavern.
“Jeffry!”
The man reflexively looked their way.
“Join us.”
“I’m sorry. Who are you?”
“I’m Captain Reece, and this is Ensign Mabbott. You are Jeffry Biggs, land broker?”
That seemed to put Jeffry at ease. He hesitated for a moment before joining them at the table. Mortimer observed his mannerisms as an odd mix of gentleman and commoner. Jeffry was pretending at being one, probably a gentleman.
There was serving bowl of Indian pudding. Mortimer pushed it toward Jeffry. He offered a spare bowl and wooden spoon to Jeffry, who took it from him. Jeffry filled his bowl. Dorian set a mug of ale at Jeffry’s place. The three ate together, trading small talk for most of the meal.
“Thank you, gentlemen, for that wonderful breakfast. Piper has excellent pudding. I am afraid we are not offering plots for sale quite yet. Once a peace treaty is signed, perhaps.”
“I imaging in time Shippensburg will be a thriving city. Handsome countryside. We are not here for that. Have you heard from your brother Ephraim?”
Jeffry paused for a moment. His facial expression changed almost imperceptibly. It was enough for Mortimer to judge that Ephraim was here recently. “No, I haven’t. He should be in New Haven.” Mortimer thought Jeffry did not sound like he expected Ephraim to actually be in New Haven.
“Should be, but he is not. He left New Haven some months ago, and I’m tasked with finding him.”
“Is he in some sort of trouble?”
Mortimer paused. As a younger brother, he would want nothing better but for his older brother to disappear. Then he would have title and would not be traipsing over the back side of America, to Mortimer’s brother’s delight. Would Jeffry protect his brother or not? Mortimer decided confronting him with a hard statement would yield a worthwhile reaction. “I’m afraid he is. Ephraim Biggs murdered an English officer last June in New Haven. I’ve been dispatched to find him for execution.”
Dorian started to react when Mortimer cut him off with a glare. It denied him the chance to see Jeffry’s reaction.
“But...No. I don’t believe it. Jeffy isn’t the murderous sort.”
Mortimer let a silent pause work for him. Colonial Colonel Whiting hated playing All Fours against Mortimer because of his ability to read the other players. He tried those tactics here. When Jeffry looked down, he gave a glance and wink to Dorian. “Tried and convicted, I’m afraid. He managed to escape the jail soon after. Ensign Mabbott and I have been in pursuit ever since. He gave us a slip in Philadelphia, but we hear rumor that he headed this way. Pray, when did you last see your brother?”
“Not since he went to Yale.”
It was a lie that Mortimer read easily. He opted to change tact. “Well, he must not have come this way, then. We were convinced he would seek refuge with family. Ensign, you may have been right. He went to Baltimore.” He noticed Jeffry relax his shoulders, though the look of shock on his face remained. “What amazed me that a Puritan ministerial student would be capable of murder with his bare hands. How is it that you became an attorney and he went a different path?”
“We weren’t born into wealth, if that’s what you mean. Our forefathers were smiths. Our grandfather came over after Queen Anne’s War. Our father did well enough to send us to college so we could advance the family’s position.”
“So you worked in the smithy as lads? That would explain Ephraim’s ability to crush a man’s throat.” Mentally, Mortimer moved the Biggs down several social pegs. Commoners pretending to be elitists. That was the mode in America, with men thinking they can climb some social ladder and forget their places. It was different for aristocrats. They already had their place. All that remained was jockeying for position.
The meal ended abruptly there. The interrogation stole whatever appetite Jeffry still had. He thanked them and left.
“What was that about?” Dorian said.
“About the conviction? I had to know whether Jeffry knew about the murder. I dressed it up a bit.” He set back in his chair. He steepled his hands together, and tapped his upper lip. “His brother went through here, but failed to tell his brother why. I doubt they are very close. Jeffry is quite a few years older. Did you notice anything else?”
“They are smiths.”
“Quite. Ephraim will not conceal himself as a pastor. Too obvious, and not as much call for that out here. Scottish Presbyterians and Purtain Separatists.”
“You suppose he reverted to smithing?”
“It makes sense. Either that or he’s fled the country and gone south.” Ensign Mabbott had not been in America for long. Mortimer decided to size him up a bit. “What course of action do you propose?”
“Well, we are close to Indian country. There are not too many places that could take a smith. He could have fled south, but his resources would only take him too far. I’ll wager a pint that he is in a nearby town working as a smith.”
“How do you propose we find out?”
“Divide our forces. Winter is fast approaching. But, if we send the men out a few days in any direction, we should figure out if he is in the area or has passed through.”
My thoughts exactly. “Sobeit. Split the team and send them out. Have them all report back in a fortnight.” Widow Piper’s is a fine place for us to headquarter until they return. See to it.”

* * *

The next morning, Dorian assembled his men and instructed them to visit the next two towns down each road, then report back. That would fit within Reece’s orders and give some indication which way Ephraim went. He told them to ask for a preacher or smith, working on the theory Ephraim was using his trade. They broke up and headed to the stable to ride on.
A few minutes later, Sergeant Tailor returned with a sheepish look on his face. “Sir, Doris has a limp.”
“Sergeant, I don’t know what you do with your mounts. They always come up limp.”
“I dunno, sir. It’s not like I had them growing up.” Sergeant Tailor’s accent came from the worst parts of London.
Ensign Mabbott knew where they found him, a jail not much farther from there. “Fine. Take myBlack Betty. She’s rock steady. But go easy on her. She’s still a bit wild.”</Text>

            <Title>Prolog</Title>
            <Synopsis>Kariwase and his band stalk up on trappers sleeping, and capture them. Bewildered, the lead trapper speaks in French, until Kariwase points out the English accent. Kariwase observes how the French &amp; Indian war started, then does the same to the trapper to the excitement of his men.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Prolog

Sunday, May 1, 1763. Rays from the pre-dawn sun filtered through the upper branches. Kariwase scanned the perimeter of the clearing. He and his fellow Shawnee smelled the smoke a few miles downwind. Over the past hour, they quietly positioned themselves around the campsite. The white trappers chose a site flanked on three sides by hills and on a fourth by the river. Kariwase thanked the Great Spirit they chose poorly.
Satisfied his warriors were in place, he stood. He walked down the incline and into the camp. The six trappers were asleep about their now extinguished camp fire. Their haul sat in a two piles: pelts in one, carcasses in another. Flies had already started the process of returning the beavers to nature. Kariwase took no notice of this, it was little different in their camps. Over the smell of rotting meat, he knew could smell the stench of the English.
He kicked one in the head, hard enough to wake him. The stomach would have been softer, but not as rewarding. He held his war mace behind his arm, hiding it from the trappers.
“Ow! Amos---“ The trapper’s voice trailed off when he looked at who kicked him. The trapper looked about, not seeing the other indians.
“What are you doing here?” Kariwase said.
“I don’t understand.” The trapper responded in French, far louder than necessary.
Kariwase switched to French. “What are you doing here? Do you understand that?”
“Yes.” Again, louder than necessary. One of the nearby trappers stirred, slowly at first, then suddenly when he realized what was going on.
“So answer me.”
“What does it look like? We are Quebecois trapping beaver.”
Kariwase tutted. “I know the Quebecois trappers in this area.”
The trapper interrupted “We’re new.”
“And I know the accent. French is not your mother tongue. You are English.”
The other trapper kicked the legs of the man next to him. His stare at Kariwase failed to mask its hostility.
“Hey!” yelped the other. The other trappers all began to rouse.
“We are not English,” the first trapper said.
“You certainly are not French, or Quebecois. Based on your accent, I would say Virginians.” Using his left hand, Kariwase pointed toward a few of his warriors on the opposing rise. The warriors, in turn, raised and lowered their flintlocks. “We killed many Virginians.”
The trapper switched to English. “Bloody fine. Then you will know you are on English, and therefore Virginian soil.”
Kariwase let that statement feed his anger. He chose instead to play with his victims. “This was my land long before it was yours.”
The trapper stood and spat. “Good luck keeping it.”
Without signaling his move, he swung the concealed war mace. He drove with his hips, putting all the power he could into the swing. The mace head connected with a satisfying thud. The trapper toppled, falling in the direction of the swing and toward the extinguished camp fire. The skull revealed the divot from the impact.
The other awake trappers recoiled in shock.
Other warriors whooped and joined in the fray. They used the butts of their flintlocks to bash the skulls of the other trappers, not discriminating whether the trappers were awake, semi-awake or asleep.
Kariwase looked on approvingly. Two of the warriors had just come of age. He thought spilling English blood was a good initiation. Rather than motion them to stop, he let them expend their energy on the corpses. It was over in a few minutes.
The carnage over, he smiled. He remembered the story of how the last war started. Tanacharison washed his hands with a Frenchman’s brains. Kariwase dropped his mace and drew his tomahawk. He hacked the Englishman’s skull open, and repeated the ritual. His fellow warriors smiled approvingly.
They know the story. Good. Soon, we will start a new war that will drive the English out of our homeland.
Kariwase and his band looted the corpses for anything useful. He distributed the beaver pelts to those who participated in the ambush. The two who held back went empty handed. They would not hold back again.

            <Text>1783-1815: French Troubles
IRL: At the end of the Seven Years’ War, England’s strategy in the Treaty of Paris (1763) sought to deter France from start a fifth war. France, however, sought to use the treaty to give them time to rebuild and rearm. French diplomats believed that without France to keep the Americans in check, the colonists might attempt to revolt. The American Revolution was that much-desired revolt. Wikipedia. Treaty of Paris (1763). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)
The negotiations between British North America and England and discovery of Toltec Technology blunted the American desire to revolt.
•	1783-1815 - French economy collapses due to Seven Year’s War debt and speculation and takes the government with it. The French Revolution is a decade early, ends the same but with American participation in Europe.
•	1802-1815 - War between France and most of Europe. Ended by British &amp; American deployment of Toltec weaponry
The French economy struggles under reparations required in the Treaty of Paris (1763). The government gets caught up in various schemes to pay the debt that results in a popular uprising in 1783.
Napoleon is involved as a republican during the early stages of the struggle, and gains power as expected. England takes control of New Orleans when Napoleon moves on Spain, and keeps it. Napoleon sends troops in 1801, triggering the war between England and France &amp; Spain (the latter as a vassal to France).
This “Napoleonic War” is ended by British &amp; American deployment of Toltec weaponry in 1815. Napoleon is executed and a new French king is placed on the throne. This ends the French Troubles.
The Louisiana Territory is kept by England as compensation for the war, and to further safeguard English interest and control over Toltec artifacts.</Text>

            <Title>Concept &amp; Theme</Title>
            <Text>**Strand** is  a [low fantasy], [Type-X] [alternative-history] series written by Ben Wilson.

In the 18th Century, British-Americans uncover an [ancient acropolis] that introduces ([advanced, ancient human]) [lost technology] in the Ohio Territory at the end of the Seven Years' War. This leads to [America remaining in the UK] despite continued struggle by the Sons of Liberty. Britain becomes a [low culture, high tech] society. We have a faction (SOL) who want to divide, and a faction (Tory) who want to unite; both want to control the strange tech, but ultimately come together to keep it from the French &amp; Indians.

Throughout the 19th Century, a secret British society reverse-engineers the [Neutrinovoltaic power][phlebotinum]. This increases degrees of separation between Britain and the rest of the world, creating a [decade dissonance]. A technological espionage struggle ensues among the great powers. The Napoleonic &amp; Crimean wars occur per OTL, but with different outcomes. British North America starts its Western expansion, leading to the Mexican war, which becomes British.

By the 20th Century, technological equilibrium is established with Britain replicating its IRL trade dominance benefiting Europe. The UK re-invents slipstream travel, with Albert Strand ultimately strand on Elysion and trying to get home. Belize becomes the launch region for space travel.

In Strand Series, we explore the perennial struggle of a society when its technological capabilities out-strips its morality. Most Americans do not understand the technology they use. Nor are they interested in its long-term implications. We also explore the tension between centralism/de-centralism, individualism, etc. As religion was a significant part of society, Christianity will be explored in a manner non-threatening to the reader.

We also explain how American remaining a part of Great Britain would not have hindered our global dominance. But, what about the Bill of Rights &amp; Constitution?

Panoramic view of the heart of Franklin County, PA
Chambersburg is a borough in and the county seat of Franklin County, in the South Central region of Pennsylvania, United States. It is in the Cumberland Valley, which is part of the Great Appalachian Valley, and 13 miles (21 km) north of Maryland and the Mason-Dixon line and 52 miles (84 km) southwest of Harrisburg, the state capital. According to the United States Census Bureau, Chambersburg's 2010 population was 20,268.[5] When combined with the surrounding Greene, Hamilton, and Guilford Townships, the population of Greater Chambersburg is 52,273 people. The Chambersburg, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area includes surrounding Franklin County, and in 2010 included 149,618 people.[6]

According to the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, Chambersburg Borough is the thirteenth largest municipality in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the largest Borough, as measured by fiscal size (2016). Chambersburg Borough is organized under the Pennsylvania Borough Code and is not a home-rule municipality.

Chambersburg's settlement began in 1730 when water mills were built at the confluence of Conococheague Creek and Falling Spring Creek that now run through the center of the town. Its history includes episodes relating to the French and Indian War, the Whiskey Rebellion, John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, and the American Civil War. The borough was the only major northern community burned down by Confederate forces during the war, which led to accusations of war crimes.[7][8]

Chambersburg is located along the Lincoln Highway, U.S. 30, between McConnellsburg and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and along U.S. 11, the Molly Pitcher Highway, between Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, and Hagerstown, Maryland. Interstate 81 skirts the borough to its east. The town also lies approximately midpoint on US Route 30 between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia with the local geography reflecting both flatter areas like Philadelphia and mountainous areas like Pittsburgh.

History[edit]
European settlement[edit]
Native Americans living or hunting in the area during the 18th century included the Iroquois, Lenape, and Shawnee.[9] The Lenape lived mostly to the east, with the Iroquois to the north and the Shawnee to the south. Traders, hunters, and warriors traveled on the north-south route sometimes called the "Virginia path" through the Cumberland Valley, from New York through what became Carlisle and Shippensburg, then through what would become Hagerstown, Maryland, crossing the Potomac River into the Shenandoah Valley.[10]


1751 Fry-Jefferson map depicting 'The Great Waggon Road to Philadelphia'
Benjamin Chambers, a Scots-Irish immigrant, settled "Falling Spring" in 1730, building a grist mill and saw mill by a then-26-foot-high (7.9 m) waterfall where Falling Spring Creek joined Conococheague Creek.[11][12] The creek provided power for the mills, and soon a settlement grew and became known as "Falling Spring."

On March 30, 1734, Chambers received a "Blunston license" for 400 acres (160 ha), from a representative of the Penn family, but European settlement in the area remained of questionable legality until the treaty ending the French and Indian War, because not all Indian tribes with land claims had signed treaties.[11][13] The Penn family encouraged settlement in the area in order to strengthen its case in a border dispute with the Maryland Colony, which had resulted in hostilities known as Cresap's War. This dispute was not settled until 1767, with the border survey which gave rise to the Mason-Dixon line. Chambers traveled to England to testify in support of Penn's claims.[14] To maintain peace with the Indians, European settlers were sometimes removed from nearby areas. In May 1750, Benjamin Chambers helped remove settlers from the nearby Burnt Cabins, named after an incident.[15][16]

The area was initially officially classified as part of Chester County, then Lancaster County (as that was created from Chester County's western area). Then Lancaster County was split, with its western portion renamed as Cumberland County; finally another split (this time of Cumberland County) established Franklin County in 1784 (so Adams County adjoins it on the east).[17]

The Great Wagon Road connecting Philadelphia with the Shenandoah Valley (and an east-west branch through Hagerstown and Cumberland, Maryland to the Ohio Valley known as Nemacolin's Path) passed nearby. In 1744, the road was completed through Harris's Ferry, Carlisle, Shippensburg, and Chambersburg to the Potomac River.[11] In 1748 a local militia was formed for protection against Indians, with Benjamin Chambers named as its colonel.

Chambersburg remained on the frontier during the French and Indian War. Benjamin Chambers built a private stone fort during the war, which was equipped with two 4 pounder cannons. Fighting as well as troop movements occurred nearby.[11][12][18][19] The area's population dropped from about 3,000 in 1755 as the war began, to about 300 during the conflict, and most settlers did not return until after 1764 (when the peace treaty was signed).[20] Because Chambers's fort was otherwise lightly defended, officials attempted to remove the cannons to prevent them from being captured by Indians and used against other forts. However, the attempted removal failed, and one of the cannons still remained in 1840, when it was used to celebrate Independence Day.[21] The Forbes Road and other trails going to Fort Pitt passed nearby as well.[22] The Forbes Road developed into part of the main road connecting Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and much later into US 30; Chambersburg developed as a transportation hub at the crossroads of Forbes Road and the Great Wagon Road.

Fighting continued in the area after the war, most notably the Enoch Brown school massacre during Pontiac's War and the Black Boys rebellion against British troops at Fort Loudon.[23]

The town of Chambersburg was first laid out in 1764, and lots advertised for sale on July 19 in Benjamin Franklin's Pennsylvania Gazette.


The first settlers were Scots-Irish Presbyterians; German Protestants came soon afterward. Relatively few Quakers and English Protestants (who made up a large proportion of early Pennsylvania settlers generally) settled as far west as Chambersburg. However, blacks lived in Chambersburg almost from the settlement's beginning. Benjamin Chambers owned a black female slave sometime before the French and Indian War and twenty slaves were recorded as taxable property in 1786.[25][26]

The earliest church was established by Scots-Irish Presbyterians in 1734. Chambers gave the congregation land in 1768, for an annual rent of only a single rose. Later, the First Lutheran Church and Zion Reformed Church both organized in 1780 under similar terms, so these three churches came to be known as the "Rose Rent Churches."[27] A Catholic community organized in 1785. St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church dates its founding to members purchasing a log cabin from the expanding Catholic congregation in 1811, and the congregation continued and expanded through 1830.[28][29] The Mt. Moriah First African Baptist Church dates to 1887. The Jewish cemetery dates back to 1840.[11]

1775–1858[edit]

In June 1775, soon after the Battle of Lexington, local troops were raised to fight the British in the American Revolution under the command of Benjamin Chambers's eldest son Captain James Chambers, as part of the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment.[30] These troops were among the first non-New Englanders to join the siege of Boston, arriving on August 7, 1775. James Chambers fought for seven years during the revolution, reaching the rank of Colonel of Continental army troops on September 26, 1776.[31] His two brothers, William and Benjamin, Jr., each served for much of the war and reached the rank of Captain.[32] James Chambers commanded local troops at the Battle of Long Island, and at White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth. He was part of the rear guard covering the retreat from Brooklyn, and was wounded at the Battle of Brandywine while facing Hessian troops under General Knuphausen at Chadds Ford.[33]

During the Whiskey Rebellion, local citizens raised a liberty pole in support of the rebels, and to protest conscription of soldiers to put down the rebellion. Nevertheless, these citizens were censured in a town meeting and removed the pole the next day.[34] President George Washington, while leading United States troops against the rebels, came through town on the way from Carlisle to Bedford, staying overnight on October 12, 1794. According to tradition, Washington lodged with Dr. Robert Johnson, a surgeon in the Pennsylvania line during the Revolution. This march was one of only two times that a sitting president personally commanded the military in the field. (The other was after President James Madison fled the British occupation of Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812.) After sending the troops toward Pittsburgh from Bedford under General Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee, Washington returned through Chambersburg sometime between October 21–26.[35] James Chambers was appointed a Brigadier General of Militia during the Whiskey Rebellion.[36]

Chambersburg was incorporated on March 21, 1803,[37] and declared the County Seat when the State Assembly established a formal government. The first courthouse was John Jack's tavern on the Diamond (town square) in 1784, with a permanent courthouse built in 1793, and the first county jail built 1795.[20] The "Old Jail" was built in 1818, survived the fire of 1864 and is the oldest jail building in Pennsylvania. It was originally used as the sheriff's residence and had the longest continuous use of any jail in the state, operating until 1971. Today the Old Jail is a museum and home to the Franklin County – Kittochtinny Historical Society.[38] The county's gallows still stand in the jail's courtyard.[39]

Much of the town's growth was due to its position as a transportation center, first as the starting point on the Forbes Road to Pittsburgh. The U.S. Congress placed Chambersburg on the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh postal road in 1803. The road was rebuilt as the Chambersburg-Bedford Turnpike in 1811. The Cumberland Valley Railroad was built in 1837 and was the area's center of economic activity for nearly 100 years. Until the completion of the Pennsylvania Railroad's main line in 1857, the fastest route from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia was by stagecoach from Pittsburgh to Chambersburg, and then by train to Philadelphia.

Civil War era[edit]

By 1859, Chambersburg and its active community of free and enslaved blacks and sympathetic whites was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Several schools taught black children, although such activity was illegal in Virginia and other slave states further south. John Brown stayed in an upstairs room at Mary Ritner's boarding house between June and October, 1859 while preparing for his raid on Harpers Ferry (then in Virginia).[40] Several of his fellow raiders stayed in the house as well, and four of them escaped capture and briefly visited the house after the raid. The house still stands at 225 East King Street. While in Chambersburg, Brown posed as Dr. Isaac Smith, an iron mine developer, and bought, shipped, and stored weapons under the guise of mining equipment.[41]

Brown (using the name John Smith) and John Henry Kagi met with Frederick Douglass and Shields Green at an abandoned quarry outside of town to discuss the raid on August 19.[42] According to Douglass's account, Brown described the planned raid in detail and Douglass advised him against it. Douglass also provided $10 from a supporter, and had helped Green – a future raider – locate Brown.

First two Confederate occupations, selective burnings[edit]
Main article: Chambersburg Raid
During the American Civil War on October 10, 1862, Confederate Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, with 1,800 cavalrymen, raided Chambersburg, destroying $250,000 of railroad property and taking 500 guns, hundreds of horses, and at least "eight young colored men and boys."[43] They failed, however, to accomplish one of the main targets of the raid: to burn the railroad bridge across the Conococheague Creek at Scotland, five miles (8 km) north of town.[44]

During the early days of the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, a Virginia cavalry brigade under Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins occupied the town and burned several warehouses and Cumberland Valley Railroad structures and the bridge at Scotland. From June 24–28, 1863, much of the Army of Northern Virginia passed through Chambersburg[45][46] en route to Carlisle and Gettysburg, and Robert E. Lee established his headquarters at a nearby farm.

July 30, 1864 devastation[edit]

The following year, Chambersburg was invaded for a third time, as cavalry, dispatched from the Shenandoah Valley by Jubal Early, arrived.[7] On July 30, 1864, a large portion of the town was burned down by Brig. Gen. John McCausland for failing to provide a ransom of $500,000 in U.S. currency, or $100,000 in gold, although the local bank had sent its reserves out of town for safekeeping.[47][48][49] Among the few buildings left standing was the Masonic Temple, which had been guarded under orders by a Confederate mason.[50] Norland, the home of Republican politician and editor Alexander McClure, was burned even though it was well north of the main fire. The ransom had been ordered by Early as compensation for residents of the Shenandoah Valley whose homes has been burned by Brig.-Gen. David Hunter, who also burned the Virginia Military Institute.[51]

One black Chambersburg resident was killed when Confederates refused to allow him to leave his burning house. Another man was asked by the Confederates if he had ever educated "niggers"; after replying that he had, the Confederates burned his house as well.[52] Subsequently, "Remember Chambersburg" soon became a Union battle cry.[53]

Civil War Legacy[edit]
Accusations of war crimes[edit]

Accused war criminal, General Early, disguised as a farmer, while escaping to Mexico, 1865.
Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early was accused of war crimes for ordering Chambersburg burned. The actual burning divided two of his cavalry commanders, because when Maryland-born Gen. Joseph "Allegheny" Johnson saw the behavior of Gen. McCausland's troops in Chambersburg, he refused to participate in a similar burning at Cumberland and Hancock, Maryland not far to the south, so both those towns survived despite likewise not paying ransoms.[54] Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. William W. Averill, although initially misdirected toward Baltimore and thus late to arrive to prevent the atrocities, also pursued the Confederates, who sustained several defeats and lost most of the Shenandoah Valley by November. Furthermore, when the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered on April 9, 1865, Early escaped to Texas by horseback, where he hoped to find a Confederate force still holding out. He proceeded to Mexico, and from there, sailed to Cuba and Canada. Living in Toronto, he wrote his memoir, A Memoir of the Last Year of the War for Independence, in the Confederate States of America, which focused on his Valley Campaign and was published in 1867.

Chambersburg's Reconstruction[edit]
A combination of state and private funding rebuilt Chambersburg. However, many new buildings were erected quickly and not initially built to the original standards. It took more than 30 years to fully restore the town's housing stock to pre-Civil War standards. As discussed further below, Chambersburg was the site of one of the 69 schools established by Pennsylvania to educate children orphaned by the war, and which remained when all other such were closed decades later. Known as "The Scotland School for Veterans Children" after the 1890s, it remained open until 2010 and graduated more than 10,000 children during its lifetime.

Memorialization of Civil War[edit]

"Fountain, Memorial Square, Chambersburg, Pa." 1921 post card.
Since people from Chambersburg had relatives on both sides during the war, and the war devastated the town, the town event also became a part of the town's identity. On July 17, 1878, 15,000 people attended dedication of Memorial Fountain in the town's center, which honors the Civil War soldiers, and later Chambersburg's fighters in other wars. A statue of a Union soldier stands next to the fountain, facing south to guard against the return of southern raiders.

To this day, the Civil War burning of Chambersburg remains a part of the town's historic identity and yearly memorial events are held, especially near July 30.

Chambersburg has also recently been the subject of study on how people have historically perceived and responded to war tragedies.[citation needed]

According to the United States Census Bureau, Chambersburg has a total area of 6.8 square miles (17.6 km2), all land. The elevation is 617 feet (188 m) above sea level.[58] Chambersburg is located in the Cumberland Valley next to the Appalachian Mountains. It also sits right outside of Caledonia State Park, a 1,125-acre (455 ha) park with fishing and hunting areas and hiking trails, including a section of the Appalachian Trail. Also outside of Chambersburg is Michaux State Forest, a 85,000-acre (34,000 ha) forest. Both of these places provide recreation for residents.

Conococheague Creek, a noted trout stream, runs through the center of town. It is a tributary of the Potomac River. The northernmost reach of the Potomac watershed is a few miles north of town.

Chambersburg has a cold climate, according to the United States Department of Energy.[59][60] The area receives anywhere from 38 to 42 inches (970 to 1,070 mm) of precipitation per year.[61] Chambersburg falls within the warmest part of the Humid Continental Climate with some characteristics in the summer of a Humid Subtropical Climate, but bears much more characteristics of the former. The average January low is 20 °F (−7 °C) and the average high is 37 °F (3 °C). The average July high is 85 °F (29 °C) and the average low is 62 °F (17 °C).[62]

The surrounding area has a large farming population, including many Amish and Mennonite families. Franklin County's largest crop is corn (maize) with 579 farms that cover 29,916 acres (12,107 ha) of land. Franklin also has 344 wheat farms and 299 barley farms which combined cover 14,063 acres (5,691 ha).[67] Manufacturing in Chambersburg includes machinery production, metal fabrication, and food processing according to the 1997 Economic Census of Franklin County.[68] The largest sectors by payroll were manufacturing companies such as T B Wood's Inc., Manitowoc cranes, retail trade, and health care and social assistance. Despite suburban growth, much of the economy of the area is still largely based on agriculture.[37]

Retail stores such as Wal-Mart and Lowe's serve the population with jobs and basic needs. The Chambersburg Mall with one anchor store and about thirty-three vacant stores is located in the unincorporated village of Scotland, about four miles (6 km) north of town on Interstate 81.[69] Chambersburg's retail sector has grown quickly since 2006 with the opening of Target, Petsmart, Michaels, and Kohls near the newly built Exit 17 of Interstate 81. Several restaurants new to the region have also opened, including Sonic, Starbucks, T.G.I. Fridays, Red Robin, Fuddruckers, Ruby Tuesday, Panera Bread, Chipotle, Texas Roadhouse, Olive Garden, and Longhorn Steakhouse.

Chambersburg's 5 largest employers, according to the Borough's Consolidated Annual Financial Report were in 2017: Summit Health Services/Chambersburg Hospital with 3,600 employees, the Chambersburg Area School District with 1,125 employees, Menno Haven retirement community with 705 employees, Franklin County government with 690 employees, and Ventura Foods with 630 employees[70]

The city's location on Interstate 81 within 100 miles (160 km) of both Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland encourages trucking and distribution businesses.[71] The Letterkenny Army Depot five miles (8 km) north of town is a major employer. Camp David also employs Chambersburg residents. In 2004 Chambersburg had a per capita personal income (PCPI) of $28,208, below the national average of $33,050.[72]

Culture[edit]

Caledonia State Park

Capitol Theatre
Chambersburg is part of small town America. Recreation includes hunting, sports events such as baseball games at Henninger Field, and high school football games. The town also hosts a professional football team, the Chambersburg Cardinals, that plays in the Gridiron Developmental Football League. People in the area speak in Pittsburgh English or with a Central Pennsylvania accent, over-pronouncing "O's" and "I's". Caledonia State Park provides an area for outdoor activities, with the park especially busy on July 4.

The Capitol Theatre was opened as a movie palace on Main Street in 1927. In 2003, it reopened as the Capitol Theatre Center and is home to the Capitol Theatre Main Stage and Auditorium, Chambersburg Council for the Arts, Caledonia Theatre Company, Chambersburg Ballet Theatre School, and Chambersburg Community Theatre.[73] In 2009, Chambersburg ranked among Newsmax magazine's list of the "Top 25 Most Uniquely American Cities and Towns," a piece written by current CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg. In determining his ranking, Greenberg cited the Capitol Theatre.[74]

Wilson College is home to the Cumberland Valley School of Music, a local school offering private instruction on various musical instruments. It offers a wide range of lessons, classes, workshops, and summer camps, as well as presenting numerous recitals and concerts in Thomson Hall. CVSM sponsors a children's chorus (the Cumberbunds), a community band, a community orchestra, a concert jazz band, and the New Horizons Band, for adults age 50 or older.

Journalist David Brooks in 2001 used Chambersburg and Franklin County to typify Republican "Red America." According to Brooks, there is little obvious income inequality and people don't define their place in society by their income level. They value the work ethic and are anti-union, anti-welfare, pro-free market, and religious social conservatives.

Government[edit]
The municipal government operates under the Pennsylvania Borough Code, with the Town Council holding both legislative and executive authority. The ten council members are elected from five wards; two from each ward with staggered four-year terms. The Mayor administers the Police Department and can cast tie-breaking votes on the Council. Other departments are administered by the Borough Manager. The current Borough Manager is Jeffrey Stonehill.[76][77]

Walter Bietsch became Mayor on January 2, 2018.[78]

Further information: Chambersburg Area Senior High School
Wilson College[edit]
Wilson College is a private, Presbyterian-related, liberal arts college founded in 1869 as a women's college and named for its first major donor, Sarah Wilson of Chambersburg. The college has about 800 undergraduate students and is known for its Women With Children, Veterinary Medical Technician, and Equestrian programs. Once an all women's school, it began admitting male students in 2013. In 2009, the school opened the first "green" campus building, housing the science and technology department and featuring a full-length waterfall which begins on the third floor and ends in the building's basement.

Public schools[edit]

Chambersburg High School in 1921
Chambersburg Area Senior High School (CASHS) is a public school with around 2,400 students in grades 9–12, drawn from the borough of Chambersburg and the surrounding townships of Hamilton, Greene, Lurgan, Letterkenny and Guilford. CASHS is accredited by the Middle States Association and has occupied its current facilities since 1955. Principal Dr. Barry Purvis was recognized as the 2006 High School Principal of the Year by the Pennsylvania Association of Elementary and Secondary School Principals.[80]

Until August 2011, J. Frank Faust Junior High School was the only public junior high school for eighth and ninth grade students of the Chambersburg Area School District. It served about 1400 students. J. Frank Faust is now a middle school for Chambersburg area students in the north. CAMS NORTH. It has 6th through 8th grade.

Chambersburg Area Middle School SOUTH was the only middle school, but as of August 2011, it became CAMS SOUTH, 6th through 8th grade. During the 2001–02 school year, CAMS was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education,[81] the highest award an American school can receive.[82][83]

The Franklin County Career and Technology Center is also located in Chambersburg. FCCTC is a school designated for students and adults to learn vocational trades while still learning core subjects in school. The school offers training in about 20–30 different concentrations. There are currently six different school districts with students attending FCCTC: Chambersburg, Fannett-Metal, Greencastle-Antrim, Shippensburg, Tuscarora, and Waynesboro.[84]

The Chambersburg school district includes seventeen elementary schools. Many school are being upgraded, rebuilt, or closed because of out-of-date buildings and lack of space. As of July 2008, the current School Board President is Stanley Helman. Other members include Anne Boryan, Renee Sharpe, Norman Blowers, Lori Leedy, Fred Rice, Dave Schiamanna, and Joe Tosten. One seat is currently being filled after the resignation of the previous board president, Dr. Thomas Orndorff. [85]

Scotland School for Veterans' Children[edit]
The Scotland School for Veterans' Children (SSVC) was a state owned school that offered tuition-free residential education for children of Pennsylvania residents who are veterans or are currently serving in the U.S. armed forces.[86] Scotland School was founded in 1863 after two orphaned children begging for food knocked on the door of Pennsylvania's governor, Andrew Gregg Curtin of Centre County north of Chambersburg. Governor Curtin and his wife realized the orphaned children of Pennsylvania's many soldiers had been forgotten. He established 70 'Soldier's Orphan Schools' across the state. Over time, the number of eligible students declined, and in 1895 all of the schools closed except that located in the unincorporated village of Scotland about four miles (6 km) north of Chambersburg. The name was changed to Scotland School for Veteran's Children, then the Pennsylvania Soldiers Orphans Industrial School, and eligibility criteria changed to provide an education to any child of any veteran, whether that veteran was living or deceased (so the school's founding date is sometimes 1895). It had about 300 students in grades 3–12, annually. More than 10,000 students were educated at the school before it closed in 2009, when Pennsylvania's legislators concurred in the decision of Governor Ed Rendell to remove funding.[87] The 186-acre (75 ha) campus contains about 70 buildings including residential cottages.[88]

Private schools[edit]
Private schools include Corpus Christi, a Catholic school with 310 students and over 20 teachers[89] and Cumberland Valley Christian School, a private Christian kindergarten through twelfth grade academy located in Chambersburg. Cumberland Valley Christian School is affiliated with the Open Door Church and has approximately four hundred students. Other private schools include the Montessori Academy of Chambersburg (22 months-12th grade, non-sectarian[90]) and Shalom Christian Academy (K-12, Mennonite affiliation) a pre-K through twelfth grade academy with approximately five hundred students, and several elementary schools with Mennonite, Baptist, Brethren, Christian Science, and other religious orientations.[91]

Library[edit]

Coyle Free Library[92] has roots going back to 1891,[93] when a library of 166 books was organized by the local Afternoon Club. A member of the club, Blanche Coyle, left a bequest of $30,435 in 1915 to construct a library building. The building was completed in 1924, located at the corner of Second and Queen Streets. Later the library was made part of the Franklin County Library and began to receive funds from the County and State, though the Afternoon Club still donated funds through at least 1979. The building it currently occupies is a former post office.

Media[edit]
Newspapers[edit]
The Chambersburg Public Opinion is the only daily newspaper published in town, and has weekday circulation about 17,000. It was founded in 1869 and is now owned by Gannett.[94]

Television and radio[edit]
Television reception can be poor because of the surrounding mountains. WJAL , a family oriented station broadcasts from Chambersburg, (local broadcasts ended September, 2017)[95] and Harrisburg PBS station WITF-TV rebroadcasts via low-powered translator W34FM-D. Franklin County is included in Washington DMA, however most stations cone from the Harrisburg-Lancaster-York market. All Harrisburg TV stations are available off air and on cable. WHTM is the first network affiliated television station to establish a bureau in Chambersburg. WDVM-TV, WWPB, and WWPX, broadcast from nearby Hagerstown, Maryland.

Chambersburg shares a radio market, the 165th largest in the United States, with Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, and Hagerstown, Maryland.[96]

Shippensburg’s Fort Morris

Created by: Ellen Glunt


Video

“On July 31, 1755, following the defeat of General Braddock’s army in western Pennsylvania, Governor Robert Morris commissioned the construction of two stockade forts, one in Carlisle and one in Shippensburg. Fort Morris was one of a line of frontier defenses erected to protect local settlers and garrison provincial troops. While the location of the fort at Carlisle is well-documented, there has been much confusion over the location of Shippensburg’s small fort. For over one hundred years local historians have argued about this topic without reaching a consensus, so there are now three locations centered around the debate of Fort Morris’ site” (Marr, 2004).

Construction of Fort Morris

On July 9, 1755, Edward Morris, the governor of Shippensburg ordered that a fort be built after he learned of General Braddock’s defeat at the hands of the French and Indians. His intent was to provide protection for the troops and colonists during the French and Indian War. So, over the next year, several buildings, a 70'-deep well, and a log palisade were built. 
Fort Morris was garrisoned until the early 1760’s, but preserved for several more years due to the efforts of Edward Shippen. Also, there is a record that an officer and eighteen provincial troops were stationed in Shippensburg during the winter of 1763-1764
On March 24, 1761, Shippen wrote, “I desire everybody in Shippensburg to take care of ye Fort for I will suffer a log of it to be thrown down on any pretense whatever.”

Description of Fort Morris’ Dimensions

General Forbes described Fort Morris as “a regular square with 4 bastions and 1 gate in that curtain which faces due east towards the town. There are three swivel guns on the salient angles of SE, SW, and NW bastions, but none on the NE. These guns are so fix’d in at they can’t be pointed to any object, but in one horizontal line. Loopholes are in many places intirely wanting, and where they are, are badly and irregularly cut, being only about four feet from the ground on the outside, tho’ more in some places on the inside. There are nine huts and houses within the fort sufficient for Barracks, magazine, and storehouse for about 150-200 men, a good draw-well, and an oven.” 
The proportions of Fort Morris are described in a memorandum written on August 13, 1758 by Brigadier-General John Forbes after visiting the fort.

Controversy over the Location of Fort Morris

There are three sites in Shippensburg which have been considered to be the location of Fort Morris. The three locations in question are Burd Street, Ridge Avenue site, and the King’s Street site (Bull’s Eye). Since there are no maps that pinpoint the location of Fort Morris, researchers must rely solely on a few extant records that have been authenticated. Fortunately there are enough valid records that enable researchers to make a knowledgeable and defensible argument as to the fort’s location.

The Ridge Avenue site

This site was proposed by Hayes Eschenmann in 1987 and was located at the crest of a hill a little over .3 of a mile south of the town center.

Eschenmann believed this to be the site of the fort because there was not a gun in the NE bastion.

This location is not viable because it places the town between the fort and the dangers from the west. Also, this location is 1900 feet from the town center which would not have been easily accessible by settlers fleeing to the fort. 

A geophysical survey of a wooded tract of land at the intersection of Ridge and Walnut Streets on the south side of Shippensburg, Pa was conducted by Tethys consultants on December 19, 1990 and January 3, 1991. Tethys used a GEONICS EM-38 electromagnetic induction meter to survey the land. TCI detected no evidence of the remains of Fort Morris on the subject site. 

The King Street Site (Bull’s Eye)

The King Street location is located at the western end of Shippensburg on a prominent hill known as the Bull’s Eye by the residents. 

What factors eliminate this land as the site of Fort Morris? The first factor is this location is not conducive to the protection of settlers because it is nearly one mile from the original town center and in the 1750’s it would have been separated from the town by a large, swampy field along Middle Spring Creek. Another factor is that Edward Shippen did not purchase the 109 acre tract of land until 1762 and had the land surveyed October 16, 1762 which is seven years after Fort Morris was built to protect the colonists. The other factor is that on March 23, 1763 Edward Shippen wrote a letter concerning the standing timber located around the Bull’s Eye, which would have been cut if Fort Morris would have been located there.

Burd Street

This is the only location that matches all of the documentation regarding Fort Morris. 

This location is on a small hill just over .1 miles west of the old town center. 

Of the three disputed locations, this location is the closest to the old town center and is between the town and the dangers to the west. 

“A 12 –pound cannonball, flintlocks, brass buttons, and similar evidence of soldier’s accouterments as well as buried logs have been found in the Burd Street Area.” No other evidence of an old fort has been found anywhere in Shippensburg. 

“Thomas Barton wrote in his Journal, “At a little distance from the center of town is Fort Morris.” The Center of Shippensburg at that time was the intersection of King and Queen Streets. The Burd Street site is 800 feet from King &amp; Queen Streets.”

“On the Northeast corner of the lot at 333 E. Burd Street, is a well, 6 feet in diameter and lined with stones to the bottom. An archaeologist from the William Penn Museum looked at the site and identified it as an old well.”


David Ferry-owner of 333 East Burd Street

Preparing the Street

To prepare the site, three, 14 foot trenches were laid out in the northwest quadrant of the lot. After the trenches were excavated, twenty-six shovel test holes were dug on the west-side of the property. The shovel test holes were two feet in diameter and spaced six feet apart in a random pattern to promote detection of artifacts. 

Trench 1 contained artifacts such as, window glass, brick, red earthenwares , hard white earthenwares, clothing, jewelry, household items, and recreational items. Three of the most important unearthed artifacts were a plain creamware shard, pearlware shards, and 19th century white earthenware shards. Pearlware is a ceramic type manufactured in England between 1790 and 1840. (Warfel, 2008). 

Trench 2 contained 1,102 artifacts; many of which were similar to those found in Trench 1. A few important artifacts were a plain brass button with a convex crown, kaolin tobacco pipe bowl fragment, a kaolin tobacco pipe stem (commonly used during colonial times), Blue salt-glazed stonewares, and plain white salt-glazed stonewares.
Trench 3 contained 324 artifacts such as a plain tombac button, white salt-glazed stoneware, pearlware, and kaolin tobacco pipe bowl fragment.

A total of 2,878 artifacts were recovered during the excavation. The artifacts recovered that were from the fort period are: 22 ceramic shards, two metal buttons, one kaolin tobacco pipe stem, three kaolin tobacco pipe bowl fragments, and a piece of lead buckshot.

Can you safely "decock" a flintlock weapon?
I know that you can grab the hammer while pulling the trigger releasing it slowly, as with most modern firearms. But will that damage the mechanism in any way? I remember reading somewhere that it does. I'm just curious.

Yes, the safest method is to tilt back the frizzen to get it out of the way in case you lose control of the hammer/flint, and then blow out the powder in the flash pan with a quick breath of air. Then hold the hammer/flint and pull the trigger while maintaining a hold on the hammer and trigger and lower the hammer to the desired position, then release the trigger pressure. If that would cause damage to a lock, then I wouldn't have that lock on the gun to begin with, because it would be defective. It's fine to do. 
Most flintlocks will have a half-cock that people used to set the hammer on while carrying a loaded pistol or rifle. It's not the safest thing to do, but that's how they used to do it. They would then draw the hammer back to fullcocked position to fire.

What you read about that damaging the mechanism  is very doubtful since what you are doing is slowing the hammer travel and unless there was a very weak linkage it should take the maneuver.   What you read may have been an application of dry firing a gun which can break a firing pin.

History[edit]
During the mid-1750s, the mountainous ridges and valleys of south central Pennsylvania were an important theater for colliding European and Native American cultures. The "no man's land" of the time, these unsettled forests were located between colonial Philadelphia to the east and the Ohio Country to the west [1] The area that is located in the southeastern part of modern-day Huntingdon County lay along new trade routes through the mountains. Before the construction of Fort Shirley, a small trading post built by George Croghan[2] was located along one of the routes. Croghan, an Irish immigrant referred to as the "King of the Traders," made his home in the fertile fields along Aughwick Creek, just north of the modern-day Shirleysburg (Volwiler 1926). It was here that a well-populated settlement, Aughwick Old Town, sprang up adjacent to George Croghan's homestead and trading post.[citation needed] Because of Croghan's presence, the location became an important council place between Natives and the provincial government of Pennsylvania. (Donehoo, "Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania", 1928, p. 8) Aughwick was chosen as a prime location to keep a safe distance from the French at Fort Duquesne, who put a price on his head, as well as the authorities back east, that would arrest him for bankruptcy since his trading activity was interrupted by the start of the Seven Years' War.[citation needed]

In 1754, Washington suffered a defeat and Natives Americans loyal to British, including tribal leader and acquaintance of George Washington, Queen Aliquippa and the Half King sought safety at Aughwick under the care of George Croghan. In 1755, after General Edward Braddock' s defeat George Croghan and followers, including Native Americans, return to Aughwick and in summer months fortify the trading post. In 1756 Armstrong uses the site, then Fort Shirley, as a staging area to attack Kittanning.

The Kittanning Expedition[edit]
In September 1755, Croghan fortified the post[2] after General Edward Braddock's defeat at the Battle of the Monongahela. This was done in order to protect his stores and the 200 Iroquois that had fled there after George Washington's defeat at Fort Necessity.[citation needed] A few months later, the post was taken over by Pennsylvania. The post became a small fort that would protect villagers against attacking Natives, and would be a launching point for militia expeditions. Shirley along with Forts Granville, Lyttelton and Patterson formed a defensive chain that stretched from the lower Juniata River and Aughwick Creek valleys.[3] Croghan's fort was strengthened by provincial troops and officially named Fort Shirley early in 1756 by the British under Hugh Mercer.[citation needed]

After Braddock's defeat, the forts in the Juniata Valley came under attack by several Native tribes, as well as French troops. The worst of these attacks came at Fort Granville on August 3, 1756 when Louis Coulon de Villiers succeeded in taking the outpost, and in the process killed the lieutenant in charge of the fort. Fort Shirley served as Colonel John Armstrong's advanced post for the raid on Kittanning in the fall of 1756; and although the expedition was viewed as a success, this garrison was abandoned by Provincial forces later that September.[4]

Fort Shirley on the Cultural Landscape[edit]
Located in Southern Huntingdon County, Aughwick Creek is a tributary of the Juniata River, providing a travel route through the rugged mountains of Pennsylvania's Ridge and Valley Province. The land north of present-day Shirleysburg occupies prime agricultural ground on the eastern bank of the Aughwick, where the floodplain is wide along the bend in the creek.[citation needed]

A small tributary stream, named Fort Run, joins Aughwick Creek at the northern end of a farmed corn field. The story of Fort Shirley cannot be told without elaborating on the life of its "high profile" founder, George Croghan, who likely had his eye on this land as early as 1747 during his expeditions as a trader. He built a house and trading post here in 1753 after moving from the Cumberland Valley. Weiser (1916) writes: "This famous valley heretofore referred to as Aughwick, is described as being in the extreme southern part of Huntingdon County, one of a series of valleys through whose entire length ran the celebrated path from Kittanning to Philadelphia, being the great western highway for footmen and packhorses" (1916:573).

The Evans Map, dated 1749, guided trade and travel from Philadelphia and Lancaster to the central mountains of Pennsylvania. Of specific interest is the westward route labeled "new trail" that ends just past Black Log. Croghan's homestead was off the map to the west.

Always pushing the envelope of the western frontier, Croghan states in a letter written to Sir William Johnson dated September 10, 1755: "I Live 30 Miles back of all Inhabitance on ye fronteers…" (Volwiler 1926, 48). By 1755, Croghan was essentially "hiding out" in the back country of the province, since he lost many assets provisioning Braddock's expedition, in addition to his losses in the Ohio Country during the previous year.

An early map of south-central Pennsylvania was produced by John Armstrong in 1755, and showed the proposed chain of forts to protect the western frontier (Waddell and Bomberger 1996, 18-19). Darlington's 1882 map was copied from Armstrong's map on file at the Public Record Office in London. Croghan was commissioned by the Provincial governor to manage the establishment of this line of forts in 1755, and used his existing fort for the defensive location at Aughwick.

The European concept of lines of forts was no doubt influenced by local topography, in that their presence facilitated the movement of goods and people through travel arteries and provided fortified refuges in times of hostility. A similar situation is documented in colonial Massachusetts, wherein a chain of frontier forts traversed a straight-line distance of 38 miles over the rough terrain of the northern Berkshires. Coe writes: "[a]ll construction in them was timber, with no masonry beyond chimneys and chimney bases, and no earthworks" (2006:5). One of Coe's archaeological case studies was also called Fort Shirley, by the same namesake. Another similarity lies in the pioneering activities of the local leaders and the speculation of "wild lands".

Croghan's Trading Post and Aughwick Oldtown[edit]
To reveal the location of Fort Shirley, it is necessary to understand the cultural and geographical significance of the settled land adjacent to the fort. A substantial settlement, Aughwick Old Town, developed around George Croghan's homestead, a place where Native Americans and whites conducted trade and found refuge. In a letter dated 16 August 1754, Croghan wrote to the governor of the province that the Half King and his fellow Mingo Seneca people had been staying with him at Aughwick since Washington's defeat (Hazard 1897, 140-141).

In a deposition given on August 27, 1754 on file in The British Public Records Office, some Native American allies of Washington informed a Captain John B. W. Shaw that they were going to "Jemmy Arther" for protection. The reference to Jemmy Arther is likely an early reference to the trading post of Jerhemia Wardner, employer of George Croghan. Having no place to go after losing their village at the Forks of the Ohio, the Half King expected his people to be harbored and protected by the provincial government of Pennsylvania. Croghan pleaded to the governor that he could not provide for this many families alone and that he needed funding or compensation.

Conrad Weiser visited Croghan's homestead at Aughwick on September 3, 1754 to investigate the situation and reported to Governor Hamilton that Croghan had a plentiful bounty of butter, milk, squash, pumpkins, and ample acres of the best Indian corn he had ever seen. Included in the Pennsylvania Colonial Records, Weiser also reported that; "…he had encountered about twenty cabins about Croghan's house, and in them at least 200 Indians, men, women and children…" (Hazard 1878, 149). From announcements regarding runaway slaves near the frontier, we know that Croghan was listed as a contact person for their return. Croghan attracted quite a population with his entourage of partners, employees, servants, slaves, and pack teams, when widespread violence and military actions disrupted his thriving business.

As the political climate was abruptly changing during the time leading up to the French and Indian War, Croghan emerged as a colonial militia leader and the most capable Indian Agent. Croghan scouted for and supplied Braddock's failed expedition during the summer of 1755; in fact, he and his seven scouts made the first engagement with French forces. Had Braddock accepted the help of the Seneca, Mingo, and Oneida warriors rallied by Croghan, the results may have been much different; however, only seven of the 40 warriors that traveled with him from Aughwick took part in the expedition due to Braddock's distrust of them.

After Braddock's death and upon returning to his home, Croghan received credible intelligence reports that war parties from Kittanning were planning to attack the frontier from the West. Rather than waiting for provincial funding, Croghan erected a stockade fort at his own expense during the fall of 1755 to protect his stores and the settlement at Aughwick Old Town.

The Fort[edit]
A cunning frontiersman, Croghan had no doubt thought out his homestead's defenses, so when the time came to formally fortify his position during the fall of 1755 he likely incorporated existing buildings into the stockade enclosure. He was quite familiar with the fighting tactics of Native American war parties, and was looked to by the provincial government as an expert on fort construction. In addition to his fort at Aughwick, Croghan laid the plans for and oversaw the beginning of the construction of Fort Lyttleton.

The situation at Aughwick was somewhat different from the erection of military forts, as Croghan's fort was built after his cabin and store houses, implying that they influenced the positioning of the stockade. He is reported to have done the construction with the help of his men and local labor. Originally referred to as "Croghan's fort", it was taken over by provincial forces and renamed "Fort Shirley" in January 1756. Croghan was commissioned by the Governor as a captain and commanded Fort Shirley for the first three months of 1756 until Captain Mercer assumed command of the garrison of 75 men. In a letter written by Governor Morris to General Shirley, dated February 9, 1756 (and published by in the Pennsylvania Archives) Hazard writes;

"…about twenty miles northward of Fort Lyttelton, at a place called Aughwick, another fort is erected something larger than Fort Lyttelton, which I have taken the liberty of naming Fort Shirley. This stands near the great path used by the Indians and Indians traders, to and from the Ohio, and consequently the easiest way of access for the Indians into the settlements of this Province" (1878, 569). The fort remained active as a key outpost till its abandonment was ordered by the governor in 1756. Montgomery writes: "We see thus that Fort Shirley during the times of Braddock's disastrous venture was an important post to and from which bodies of armed men under Provincial authority were being constantly directed…" (1916, 573). Due to its advanced location, Colonel Armstrong and his troops set off from Fort Shirley on August 29, 1756 during the Kittanning Expedition in reprisal for the destruction of Fort Granville.

Written in the Minutes of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania Volume VII (Hazard):

"As Fort Shirley is not easily defended, and their Water may be taken possession of by the Enemy, it running at a Foot of a high bank Eastward of the Fort, and no well Dugg, I am of Opinion, from its remote situation, that it can't serve the country in the present Circumstances…" (1851, 32-233).

According to Hunter:

"Except that it was a stockade fort and that it was 'something larger than fort Lyttelton,' little is definitely known about the structure of this defense" (Hunter 1960, 394). General Forbes described Fort Lyttleton and Fort Louden as measuring 100 feet square; thus providing a minimum size for the stockade of Fort Shirley.

Court Cases and Deeds The ownership of the tract where the fort once stood can be tracked by using deeds and surveys available on the PHMC website and other sources. Croghan was the first owner of the land where the fort stood after the area was opened up for settlement. In fact, he is said to have purchased the Aughwick tract from the Onondaga rather than from the Penn family; and therefore, this transaction was a point of contention with the provincial government.

Ownership of Croghan's land at Aughwick was contested in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in a case heard in Huntingdon in 1799. In this case John Armstrong's sons, James and John Jr., were defending their ownership of the land along with Thomas Duncan against John Morgan, the plaintiff (Hudson 1849, 141-152; and Cases of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court circa 1803: 529-530).

After a visit to the local survey company, Africa Engineers, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, we believe that we have found the map of the survey ordered (if not done by) (Figure 2) John Armstrong; who, had a vested personal interest in the property at Aughwick as he owned the deed to one of the three tracts (also redrawn and reprinted in Africa 1883, 342a).

The parcel appears again in the records when the land is deeded to James Fowley in 1773. Rev. Philip Fithian, who was commissioned to survey the Presbyterian churches scattered about Pennsylvania in 1775, wrote about the fort and his stay at the Fowley's home. Published by the Huntingdon County Historical Society, he writes in his diary: "We crossed Ofwick (Aughwick) Creek and arrived …at Mr. Fowley's who lives within the walls of old Fort Shirley" (1937:16). Ownership of the parcel is then transferred to Paul Warner in 1776 and recorded by another survey map.

In 1783 an Irish immigrant named Samuel McCammon came to Shirleysburg from Bucks County and bought the tract that included the fort stockade. This is perhaps the most important account of the change of ownership, as Mr. McCammon is reported to have built his house from the round logs of the old fort house (Jordan Vol. III 1936, 716). From this, we know that the fort stockade was still visible at this time. It is possible that all the usable wood from the stockade and structures was scavenged for use in the construction of cabins and out buildings, leaving only subsurface features and artifacts to reveal the fort's location. Any mention or surveys after this period would have been done without visual reference to the stockade.

Written accounts[edit]
There are multiple accounts, from both primary sources and historical interpretations, regarding the location of Fort Shirley; and each of these come along with their own specific complications and contradictions. The first account for the location of Fort Shirley after the Colonial Period appeared in a newspaper called The Standing Stone Banner (published 1853-1855) that was edited by J. Simpson Africa and Samuel G. Whitaker. The Banner's description appeared in the Pennsylvania Archives (Hazard 1856, 458) during the first attempt to locate the frontier forts of Pennsylvania.

In Lytle's History of Huntingdon County, he states:

"… (I am) indebted to Samuel McVitty, ESQ., formerly of Shirleysburg, now of Clay Township, this county, with reference to the natural surroundings in its immediate vicinity. The site of the fort has been frequently pointed out to him by those who had seen it, and by Isaac Morgan, who claims to have forted in it in his boyhood days. It was a log fort of considerable strength and size, standing on the edge of the plateau, south of the fort run and west of the road entering Shirleysburg from Mount Union (sic) Aughwick was situated about half-way between the fort and Aughwick Creek, where the depot of the East Broad Top Railroad now stands. Mr. McVitty spent many hours of his youthful hours in gathering arrow-heads, stone tomahawks, beads, and musket balls from this historic ground" (1875, 64-65).

In his history of Huntingdon County, Africa writes:

"The fort stockade was located on the left or south bank of Fort Run, about half-way between the Benjamin Leas house and the farm of Nelson Barton, and a little south of a line drawn between the two. The house of Capt. Croghan, who was in command of the fort, stood a little west or southwest of the fort, near a large pine-tree then, and for three-quarters of a century after, standing near where the station of the East Broad Top Railroad now stands" (1883, 341-342).

A report on the frontier forts was published by Weiser (1916), but according to Waddell and Bomberger (1996) it was assembled without critical analysis or organization. However, according to Weiser:

"The writer, after an inspection of the site found it on an elevated plot of ground, where now stands the Shirleysburg Female Seminary, within the limits of the borough of Shirleysburg and on the east side of it about one-fourth of a mile from Aughwick. A small stream passes southwest through Germany Valley between the spot where the fort was located and the end of Owing's Hill, and empties into Aughwick Creek" (1916, 567-566).

The reference to an "elevated plot of ground" is unclear, as the seminary location is set back from Fort Run and its confluence with Aughwick Creek. The report also states that the fort supposedly stood opposite a high ledge of rocks used for target practice; however, modern highway construction impacted this hillside so that it cannot be used as a reference.

Another historian, Charles Hannah, presents a photo of the field from 1909, labeling it as the field where Fort Shirley Stood (Hannah 1911, 253). The Huntingdon Borough Sesquicentennial publication (1938), repeated Lytle's 1875 description of fort while Samuel McVitty recounts of local elders talking about the fort's size and recalls collecting military and Indian artifacts in the field as a child thus reinforcing an oral account of the fort's location.

One of the oldest parcel maps documenting the tract where the fort stood is dated November 23, 1762 and was obtained through the Hamilton Library Collection in Carlisle; unfortunately, the fort location is not indicated. Next we have Surveyor General Armstrong's survey map of the parcel apparently dated 1761; this, was obtained at the local engineering office and it does show a location for the fort. The map indicates that the parcel that includes the fort was deeded to Jeremiah Warder and Company in right of George Croghan. This map was later redrawn for a plate published by Africa (1883, 342a).

At first glance, the scale and proportions seemed to be relatively accurate when compared to modern aerial photographs and topographic maps of the site. Therefore, we wanted to check to see if the mapped location of the fort could mark the spot. To evaluate the accuracy of the map we went to the Huntingdon County Mapping Office where we had the map overlaid onto the GIS database.

While fitting the maps, it was discovered that the survey from Carlisle was close to 100 perches (1 perch=16.5 ft.) too short along one of the survey legs. This may explain why there is another survey map dated November 25. While a more accurate survey map, the date is difficult to decipher; thus, complicating our understanding of the timeline of events surrounding the surveys and court documents. Using distinct features as control points we attempted to match the survey maps to the modern aerial image. We then re-surveyed the three-mile-long tract using the survey notes to reveal that the boundaries match up best nearest along Aughwick Creek, while distortion and inaccuracy occurs along Owing's Hill and Fort Run. From the GIS, we know that the symbol used to represent the fort measures 600 by 400 feet, which is much too large to have been drawn to scale. Additionally, the overlay places the fort on the steep hill and in the middle of Route 522, so we know that the placement of both the fort and Fort Run are skewed. The GIS is flexible in the different view options as shown in this figure; with the redrawn parcel boundary over the areal on the left, and the parcel boundary over a hill-shade surface on the right.

Penn State University Summer Field School 2010[edit]
After reviewing the maps and assembling the written clues, a team was assembled for the Summer of 2010 to conduct a preliminary investigation of the site. The presence of a palisade fort was discovered as well as an indication of both Native Americans and activities of the troops garrisoned there.

When chosen by Croghan, the location was appealing as a good spot for a homestead rather than defensible ground for a fort. Bearing this in mind, it must consider that the 1750s landscape may have been transformed by geomorphologic processes (i.e. flooding, erosion, and stream channel migration) as well as subsequent farming activity. Before the excavation began, visual inspections of various air photo series, there are few (if any), to find apparent effects on the vegetation coverage from subsurface features. At first glance, the site appears to be a seemingly featureless cornfield; but by using clues from the written record and the maps, four localized areas are sought for additional investigation.

There are no obvious traces of the fort or any other structures from Croghan's homestead visible on the aerial photographs of the site. Adding to the complications is the fact that old Pennsylvania State Route 522 could have impacted the fort and village sites. One way to focus the search for a compound structure such as Fort Shirley is to use geophysical prospecting techniques to detect any traces of subsurface features such as foundations, the palisade wall, and the powder magazine. After narrowing the search using the written record, maps, and GIS; a geophysical survey was started in November 2009 with the help of Indiana University of Pennsylvania. A site grid has been established and the test blocks have been staked-out using a laser total station; then, ground-penetrating-radar and resistivity equipment were used to collect data during close interval traverses (0.5 or 1.0 m). The geophysical data will be interpreted further to help guide subsequent archaeological testing.

In lieu of professional archaeological excavations, conventional wisdom suggests that the site is somewhere near the Female Seminary or Leas House. In 1984, a frizzen and a .30 caliber lead ball were recovered using a metal detector (approximately 20 ft.) directly behind the Leas house. This location is nearer the old railroad station mentioned in the latter accounts of the fort, but further from the mapped location suggested by the Armstrong survey. Military and Native American artifacts are rumored to have been collected from this part of the field over the past 100 years or more; but, these accounts should be substantiated with informant interviews.

            <Text>#### Slower-than-Light Travel

Slower-than-light travel follows the IRL laws of physics. Access to Toltec technology accelerates research, leading to efficient "Edison" drives.

##### Travel Times

The table below describes the constraints of space travel. Most space ships are fuel constrained based on their acceleration ability, shown by the Duration. Travel between Earth and the slipsteam is within the limits of those ships. Those with extended durations can travel four times further than regular ships, at the expense of crew comfort. Those ships could safely make it to Uranus and back, but not to the Oort cloud.

* Civilian ships have a maximum acceleration of V-shift 3.
* Military ships have a maximum acceleration of 2G (V-shift 5.
* Slipknot (5AU), Moon, Mars (1.5AU), Uranus (19AU), Oort (0.3ly) columns all refer to travel time from Earth to those (average distance) locations. Distances between planets,[^sol-distance] Oort[^oort-distance] and Belt (1AU) [^belt-distance] are estimated for the sake of simplicity.

The table below describes the travel time between Earth and the target, as provided by the Space travel calculator.[^stl-calc]

The main (or core) population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, which are based on what is known as “Kirkwood gaps”. Named after Daniel Kirkwood, who announced in 1866 the discovery of gaps in the distance of asteroids, these gaps are similar to what is seen with Saturn’s and other gas giants’ systems of rings. https://www.notion.so/1f5ce610ebbb44d68c53e3d4c847c22d

Quakers forced themselves to accept the death penalty and advised their members on the path to avoid such a fate, prominent Quakers remained reluctant to execute except in unique cases. Both Anglicans and Quakers served on the colony‘s Supreme Court, but all four chief justices in this period (David Lloyd, Jeremiah Langhorne, James Logan, and John Kinsey) were Quakers. Despite their periodic issues with Yearly Meeting, these men struggled to mediate traditional Quaker opposition to the death penalty with the calls by many Anglicans for harsh punishments.
Rather than serve only as a form of social control, their public deaths allowed colonial leaders, including their Quaker supporters, to preserve this fragile peace on the frontier.
The execution of the Winters also revealed the Quaker-dominated Assembly‘s belief that only the colonial government possessed the authority to decide who died on the gallows despite their reluctance to use capital punishment. Not the Indians nor British.
•	Pennsylvania executed 16 persons for murder in 1760s.
•	Hanging was the method of punishment
•	Public execution was for the worst offenders
•	By the mid-eighteenth century the condemned were largely recent immigrants or native-born members of the criminal underworld.
•	Gottlieb Mittelberger
•	William Moraley, John Bruleman, Robert Scull
•	John Bruleman, a broken officer forced out of the British army for counterfeiting and became a jeweler, executed around 9 October 1760.
•	John Morrison, Joseph Cooper, criminals
•	Pennsylvania‘s murder rate in the latter half of the eighteenth century doubled that of London.
•	Sailors were 1/5th of the population, but frequently were in criminal gangs around the outskirts of Philadelphia
•	Indeed, in 1761, two deserters were suspected of murdering a woman in Shippensburg. (22 October 1761)
Local elites in Philadelphia began to develop the intellectual and cultural life of the colony with the establishment of the American Philosophical Society, Library Company, College of Philadelphia, and Pennsylvania Hospital. By all accounts, the colony had successfully surpassed many older cities such as Boston to assume a preeminent place in colonial British North America.</Text>

            <Text>Low Culture, High Tech
“The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite.”
While you don’t need to know how a gun works to know how to use one, the society as a whole must be able to support the thinkers and builders of such a device for it to see widespread and sustained use. Not so when you have Low Culture High Tech; this is a faction, culture, or race that uses technology far in advance of their scientific and cultural knowledge, often for warfare.
Usually this group has pirated the technology from someone else. It may be Lost Technology that they have recovered and use, often very sturdy, self-replicating lost tech that only requires raw materials be input, if even that. Or it could be a Black Box tech that none of their existing machines can do without. There may instead be a group of “thinkers and builders” who use the primitives as shock troops or even as a Slave Race. It’s also possible the tables are turned and the primitives have either taken the builders hostage or killed them all and taken all of their goodies (without bothering with the instruction manual). If the original source of the tech is Shrouded in Myth, they may become a Cargo Cult.
Typically, the primitives will only use a fraction of the technology’s potential and not know all of its abilities. At best they will be able to maintain the equipment without knowing how to repair it should a major malfunction happen. It’s highly possible that the original creators, or a group with sufficiently advanced science (even just curiosity and a working knowledge of the scientific method), can pull the rug out from under these primitives by either confiscating, hacking, or better using their pirated tech against them.
It’s worth noting that a civilization doesn’t have to be at stone age or Medieval levels of technology for this trope to apply. They just have to routinely use tech far in advance of their ability to comprehend. A story set in 21st century Earth could have this trope apply if the planet were given Imported Alien Phlebotinum. Even space faring peoples can have Low Culture, High Tech if they use stuff they don’t understand.
Lastly, we want to draw attention to the following from the first paragraph “far in advance of their scientific and cultural knowledge”. It’s important to point out that not only are they using things they don’t understand technologically, but for which they haven’t considered the cultural, social, or ethical ramifications. It’s one thing to give a hunter-gatherer society an Energy Bow, but giving them a cloning device? Their society may crumble from the onset of massive Cloning Blues, not to mention the ecological disaster of the massive population growth. It’s because of this that many aliens (and future humanity) tend to subscribe to an Alien Non-Interference Clause or a You Are Not Ready attitude.
Related to Insufficiently Advanced Alien, which is about a race that’s interstellar, but every other tech they have sucks comparatively, and they probably don’t understand it. Compare Crystal Spires and Togas. Contrast Rock Beats Laser. The Noble Savage inverts this trope, being essentially High Culture, Low Tech. See also Bamboo Technology, Aliens Never Invented the Wheel, Scavenger World, Giving Radio to the Romans, Technology Uplift and Cargo Cult. Not to be confused with “High Tech and Low Life.” Compare Klingon Scientists Get No Respect, when a society undervalues the profession that make its desired lifestyle possible. Not to be confused with No Tech but High Tech.
When adding Real Life examples, please use the Rule of Cautious Editing Judgment to avoid Unfortunate Implications.</Text>

            <Text>Hobbes Was Right
“The people, they know where I stand. They need rules to live by—I provide them. They break the rules, I break them. That’s the way it works. Rights? Sure, I’m all for rights. But not at the expense of order.”
The only forces capable of controlling this setting are tyrants, dictators and authoritarian groups. Any attempt at democracy is a doomed enterprise, formulated by Wide-Eyed Idealists working under the belief that there is a grain of selflessness in any person.
That this be a benevolent dictatorship is optional (in fact, the presence of a benevolent dictator would suggest Hobbes was wrong).
Named after Thomas Hobbes, who wrote in the 17th-century book Leviathan that strong, centralized government is necessary to protect mankind from its own base nature and self-serving desires. The trope is based on a Flanderized version of his philosophy. It is worth noting that many medieval kings (as an isolated example) had to be strong and bastardly to be effective. Naturally, this opinion goes hand in hand with the belief that Humans Are Bastards, possibly Humans Are Morons if the arguments are about the reliability of human judgment if power is left in the hands of the many (though when one considers who the only available candidates for rulership are—namely, members of that same species of bastard morons…). Indeed, Rousseau—the chief defender of the contrary position—had some choice words for Hobbes (although Hobbes, being dead, couldn’t appreciate the insults).
Contrast Machiavelli Was Wrong and Rousseau Was Right; compare and contrast The Extremist Was Right, The Evils of Free Will, Realpolitik and Utopia Justifies the Means. Has nothing to do with Calvin and Hobbes, though that Hobbes was named after this one. For Hobbes’ views on the supernatural, see Devil, but No God and Burn the Witch!</Text>

            <Text>Western Genre
Author and screenwriter Frank Gruber described seven plots for Westerns:[12][13]
1.	Union Pacific story. The plot concerns construction of a railroad, a telegraph line, or some other type of modern technology or transportation. Wagon train stories fall into this category.
2.	Ranch story. The plot concerns threats to the ranch from rustlers or large landowners attempting to force out the proper owners.
3.	Empire story. The plot involves building a ranch empire or an oil empire from scratch, a classic rags-to-riches plot.
4.	Revenge story. The plot often involves an elaborate chase and pursuit by a wronged individual, but it may also include elements of the classic mystery story.
5.	Cavalry and Indian story. The plot revolves around “taming” the wilderness for white settlers.
6.	Outlaw story. The outlaw gangs dominate the action.
7.	Marshal story. The lawman and his challenges drive the plot.</Text>

Indian bows were made in a variety of configurations, such as straight bows, or single or double recurve bows. As a rule, Indian bows ran about three feet in length, although they occasionally reached as long as five. Records show that their bows seldom exceeded what we know as a 60-pound pull, the necessary force to bring the bow to full draw.

            <Title>NIJ Ballistic Levels Protection ( Level IIA, Level II, Level IIIA, Level III and Level IV)</Title>
            <Text>NIJ Ballistic Levels Protection ( Level IIA, Level II, Level IIIA, Level III and Level IV)
Body armor is a critical safety piece of safety equipment that has saved the lives of thousands of people. However people who are in the market for body armor often find it difficult to assess which choice is right for them. There are a few primary factors to consider which solution will best suit their needs; threat level, heat buildup, comfort, mobility conceal-ability and cost. Threat level or protection level is typically the biggest factor when choosing body armor, and also the most difficult aspect to understand.
The U.S. National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has established and updated minimum performance stands for body armor to ensure that users will know what their body armor will protect them from. The NIJ classifies body armor into 5 different threat levels:
Level IIA, Level II, Level IIIA, Level III and Level IV; based on their ability to stop specified rounds at specified velocities. The current standard is NIJ 101.06. Also please note that while a higher level generally means protection against more powerful rounds, it does not account for other factors such as weight, or multi-hit capability. Because of this it is suggested that you choose body armor that is right for the situation and not the one that is the highest level.
NIJ Level IIA
NIJ Level IIA armor is typically soft body armor, meaning that it is composed of layers of high-strength woven fibers. Common types of these fibers are aramid fibers such as Kevlar, Twaron, and Goldflex or Polyethylene fibers such as Spectra and Dyneema. Level IIA is designed to stop a .9mm FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) round at a speed of ~1165 feet per second (ft/s) and a .40 S&amp;W FMJ at 1065 ft/s. Most often found in soft body armor vests, Level IIA is usually the lightest, most flexible, most comfortable and easiest to conceal.
NIJ Level II
A step above Level IIA is Level II which is also most commonly soft body armor. Level II is designed to protect from .9mm FMJ traveling at a speed of ~1245 ft/s and a .357 Magnum JSP (Jacketed Soft Point) at ~1,430 ft/s. Like IIA, Level II body armor is typically very light, comfortable and easy to conceal, however it provides significantly more protection against blunt force trauma (trauma caused by kinetic energy of the round hitting the plate or vest.) Because of this factor most concealable body armor vests are either Level II or Level IIIA, with Level IIA falling largely out of date.
NIJ Level IIIA
Level IIIA is designed to stop .357 Sig FMJ FN (Flat Nose) bullets traveling at a velocity of ~1470 ft/s and .44 Magnum SJHP (Semi Jacketed Hollow Point) rounds at a velocity of 1430 ft/s. Like its level IIA and Level II, Level IIIA is most commonly soft armor, however hard armor plates and ballistic shields can sometimes be found with a rating of level IIIA.
NIJ Level III
At level III, we transition to soft body armor vests to the world of ballistic plate levels. Ballistic body armor plates are also referred to as rifle plates or hard armor plates. Level III rifle plates are designed to stop 6 spaced hits of 7.62x51mm NATO FMJ (U.S. Military designation M80) at a velocity of ~2780 ft/s, which is very similar to the .308 Winchester round often used in hunting. Some manufacturers (ourselves included) also offer hard armor rifle plates that are referred to as level III+. While the NIJ does not recognize the rating of level III+, these plates typically have the + to indicate that they stop the same rounds at higher velocities or to indicate protect from NIJ threat level III plus additional threats such as M855 and M193. Level III and III+ body armor plates can be found at a variety of different price points depending on the rifle plate’s weight and material. The cheapest and heaviest of these options are typically steel body armor plates which can weigh anywhere from 8-10 lbs depending on the size of the plate. While more expensive options such as those made from Polyethylene or ceramic, can weigh as little as 3 pounds.
NIJ Level IV
Level IV ballistic plates are the highest rated hard armor plates under NIJ 101.06 standards. These hard armor plates were designed to take 1 hit from an armor-piercing rifle. These rifle plates are tested to defeat 7.62MM armor piercing (AP) bullets (also known was .30-06 or 30 ot 6) traveling at a velocity of 2880 ft/s. Please note that since level IV ballistic plates are only tested to stop 1 shot compared to 6 shots from a level III hard armor plate, a level IV hard armor plate is not always better than a level III hard armor plate. Besides NIJ certification there are other standards of bullet resistance such as the U.S. Military’s SAPI (Small Arms Protective Insert) standards, which features plates designed to military specifications. This standard first came into play with their Interceptor body armor (IBA), and later with their Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) and the Modular Tactical Vest (MTV). Since 2005, they have moved to the ESAPI (Enhanced SAPI) Program. There are also what are referred to as Special Threats plates which are designed to stop common threats while minimizing weight and cost. Typically examples of these plates are AK-47 and AR-15 plates.</Text>

            <Text>##### Mississippi Land Company

The Mississippi Land Company formed in 1763 following the British victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763) in North America. The company sought to acquire land grants in the vast former New France region between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River ceded by France to Britain after the war.

The Mississippi Land Company was formed by colonial Virginians including George Washington, John Augustine Washington, Richard Henry Lee, Arthur Lee, and William Fitzhugh. The company hoped to establish a new colony in the Mississippi Valley by petitioning the Crown for 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²) in what became Charlotina and parts of northern Mississippi.[^MississippiLandCompany]

[^MississippiLandCompany]: OTL: Their timing was poor, because the British government soon issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which put a temporary halt to the western expansion of the British colonies. Although the boundary line established by the proclamation was extended westward in the following years, the Mississippi Company was never granted lands, and ceased to operate by about 1770.

            <Text>&lt;!-- concept-overview --&gt;
**Strand** is  a [low fantasy], [Type-X] [alternative-history] series written by Ben Wilson.

In the 18th Century, British-Americans uncover an [ancient acropolis] that introduces ([advanced, ancient human]) [lost technology] in the Ohio Territory at the end of the Seven Years' War. This leads to [America remaining in the UK] despite continued struggle by the Sons of Liberty. Britain becomes a [low culture, high tech] society. We have a faction (SOL) who want to divide, and a faction (Tory) who want to unite; both want to control the strange tech, but ultimately come together to keep it from the French &amp; Indians.

Throughout the 19th Century, a secret British society reverse-engineers the [Neutrinovoltaic power][phlebotinum]. This increases degrees of separation between Britain and the rest of the world, creating a [decade dissonance]. A technological espionage struggle ensues among the great powers. The Napoleonic &amp; Crimean wars occur per OTL, but with different outcomes. British North America starts its Western expansion, leading to the Mexican war, which becomes British.

By the 20th Century, technological equilibrium is established with Britain replicating its IRL trade dominance benefiting Europe. The UK re-invents slipstream travel, with Albert Strand ultimately strand on Elysion and trying to get home. Belize becomes the launch region for space travel.

In Strand Series, we explore the perennial struggle of a society when its technological capabilities out-strips its morality. Most Americans do not understand the technology they use. Nor are they interested in its long-term implications. We also explore the tension between centralism/de-centralism, individualism, etc. As religion was a significant part of society, Christianity will be explored in a manner non-threatening to the reader.

We also explain how American remaining a part of Great Britain would not have hindered our global dominance. But, what about the Bill of Rights &amp; Constitution?

            <Text>Knight in Sour Armor
When life gives you lemons…note
The world is filled with Wide Eyed Idealists who believe in truth and justice and devote their lives to fighting for it. And then the dark, cruel and brutal world keeps letting them down. For them, Being Good Sucks. But rather than giving up on their goals, they choose to fight not because they believe they will truly make a difference, but because it’s the right thing to do.
More often than not these characters are in settings that feature Black and Gray Morality. They’re usually survivors who have largely given up on believing in Honor Before Reason, but still strive to be Lawful Good or as close to it as reality allows them to be. They are willing to bend the rules to save them. In Lighter and Softer settings, these characters are Grumpy Bears and are often mocked by the other characters for being so sour all the time.
The presence of cynicism usually makes the idealistic behavior even more noteworthy: it’s easy to love everyone when Rousseau Was Right, but you really have to be a good guy to believe that Humans Are Bastards and care about them anyway. Such characters can also be The Fettered; their cynical outlook tells them they could probably get away with all kinds of things that they don’t do because that would be wrong, and just because the world sucks doesn’t mean you need to make it worse. Then again, this kind of character goes great with a world where you Earn Your Happy Ending after much strife.
This is the inverse of the worldview of most Well Intentioned Extremists, especially those who believe that Utopia Justifies the Means. Extremists or Knight Templars may believe themselves to be this, but their actions are far too extreme. A Knight In Sour Armor believes in the rules and breaks them only when absolutely necessary, which is very rarely; not surprisingly, many have taken a Heroic Vow related to this behavior. Often has a personal set of rules, trimmed down to those that really matter in order to minimize conflicts and distractions. Contributes to the Knight’s gruff tendencies, since politeness tends to appear a lot further down the priority list than feeding orphans and so on.
Generally, these characters fit one of two personality types. Members of the first type are former Wide Eyed Idealists who have come to accept that their world is on the low end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, but who still find something beautiful in their former ideals that they want to hold on to. Those of the second type are born cynics, who would make natural Jerkass antiheroes, but who nevertheless have devoted themselves to a code of honor or fair play. In either case, these people tend to have gone through (often painful) Character Development in their past, meaning that they are normally older than the average hero.
Either way, however, the effect is basically the same: you have a Knight in Shining Armor wearing Jade-Colored Glasses; the difference between the first and second types is which comes first.
These characters show up often in Film Noir, Dark Fantasy, and Low Fantasy. Law enforcement is a particularly attractive career, but the Knight in Sour Armor will usually hold back from becoming a Cowboy Cop. Very frequently, they end up as The Mentor, a Grumpy Bear with Jade-Colored Glasses, The Last DJ, or a Cool Old Guy if they last long enough. As teammates, they are often the Sour Supporter. They also frequently end up as Hero Antagonists and extreme Woobies. This is often the final state of The Atoner post-Heel–Face Turn. Despite their cynicism, they behave like The Anti-Nihilist.
Will often overlap with The Snark Knight. Compare Angst? What Angst?, for characters who take the troubles of a good alignment with far less complaint; Noble Demon, who will proudly declare themselves evil, but still finds themselves doing good once in a while; Sour Outside, Sad Inside, for characters who sour attitude hides the fact they’re sad; and Jerkass Woobie, who spits in the face of the alignment chart. Converted Silly Rabbit, Idealism Is for Kids! or Good Is Old-Fashioned believers may well find themselves becoming this trope if the heroes can bring them around. If they don’t like idealism, but don’t like cynicism, either, then you also have a touch of Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers!
Knight in Sour Armor / Playing With
Basic Trope: A cynical character who is nevertheless obstinately good.
•	Straight: Alice Lime is an experienced police detective who honestly expects most of her cases to end in tragedy… but not for lack of trying.
•	Exaggerated: Alice is an Iron Woobie who is constantly undermined by those around her.
•	Justified:
–	As a cop Alice has witnessed Police Brutality and racial profiling, dealt with scumbag murderers and rapists, and on top that people hate her and assume she’s a Corrupt Cop just because she’s a cop.
–	Alice might think she lives in a Crapsack World, but also thinks that being Good Feels Good even though it might suck from time to time.
–	Alice might be cynical and think things will turn out for the worst, but she knows that there’s still a chance that she’s wrong and something good might happen.
–	Alice isn’t fond of the state of the world, but that’s all the more reason not to take it lying down, even if nobody else gives a shit.
•	Inverted: Alice is an up-and-running villain filled with idealistic zeal of how easily she’s going to Take Over the World.
•	Double Subverted:
–	…and so is everyone else. It’s more suspicious if you aren’t. Alice’s bribes are voluntary payments from people grateful she actually did her job.
•	Zig Zagged: The framing was actually a lie fabricated by Alice in order to hide her True Colors. Which, in itself, was a lie to preserve her cover.
•	Averted:
–	Alice is heroic, cheerful and optimistic.
–	Alice is cynical and doesn’t bother to fight on.
•	Lampshaded: “Why do you fight so hard if you know you’re just going to lose?” “Things are bad enough already. I’m not letting them get worse.”
•	Exploited: Alice is assigned the case because the criminals are more likely to mistake her for someone who can be bribed.
•	Defied: Whenever depression threatens, Alice remembers all the cases she closed successfully.
•	Discussed: “Let me tell you right now — I would rather have Det. Lime investigating my murder than any wet-behind-the-ears Wide-Eyed Idealist who thinks every criminal is always caught.”
•	Conversed: “You know, for a character as cynical as Det. Lime, she seems to be awfully heroic.”
•	Deconstructed:
–	Alternatively, she continues to protect a Crapsack World, not because it’s the right thing to do, but because she’s a Blood Knight who thrives on conflict.
–	Alice’s cynicism drives more idealistic folk away from her due to being excessively bitter whilst other cynics scorn her for futilely trying to help people.
•	Reconstructed: While she enjoys the warm fuzzies from fighting the good fight, she still goes into every case without expectations.
•	Played For Drama: Alice gets her ideas thrown back in her face by a Knight Templar or Fallen Hero who shares the same cynical beliefs as she does, forcing her to confront her own ideas and see how her attitude could create the same problems she despises.
•	Implied: Alice goes into a rant about how the world is a Crapsack World. When someone asks her why she fights, Alice gives them a meaningful look, but we don’t see what she said.

            <Title>Being Good Sucks</Title>
            <Text>Being Good Sucks
If being good were as easy as most cartoons make it out to be, everyone would be a saint. Truth is, sometimes Being Good Sucks. Doing the right thing doesn’t always feel good, is hard to pull off, can be painful, sometimes even harmful, to yourself and others. Being good requires a Heroic Sacrifice, keeping your word, and thinking of others before yourself. It means swallowing your pride, owning up to and apologizing for your mistakes. It means doing the above without expecting a reward (even a spoken thank you), refusing one if offered—and most ego-crushing—accepting the punishment for being good.
The variations are endless, but below is a condensed catalog:
•	Sacrificing your own happiness: It can be any type of happiness, be it denying romance to protect the Love Interest, or where their quest To Be a Master is leveraged against a friend’s life when the Friend or Idol Decision comes along.
•	Giving up your ambitions: Usually these are selfish or dark ambitions, and denying them helps the character in the long run. When a character wants Revenge for the murder of a loved one in a world where If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him, their giving up murder (though not necessarily forgiving the villain) will cost them dearly but ultimately be the right thing. However, this can extend to less dark goals, when Ambition Is Evil. If the story deems the character’s dream as “selfish” or bad, they have no choice but to give up.
•	Good behaviour. Obvious as it is, being good requires acting good. This means sharing, forgiving others, not killing people and generally acting contrary to one’s impulses to be a Jerkass to those disliked. No matter how much they may wish or be tempted to do otherwise.
•	Humility and honesty. Honesty is a big source of Suck when being good. It means that any wrong doing on your part (or your friends’) must be revealed. Worse, it means denying Protagonist-Centered Morality and obeying the law. The character may find that to do what is right means going against stupid laws, becoming a wanted man, separated from loved ones, with their “reputation” ruined.
•	Doing the right thing doesn’t always mean it’s the nice thing. Often in dilemmas where the character has to choose to either uphold a moral standard or being kind to others. Whether it’s doing nasty deeds to save someone’s life, telling an uncomfortable truth, or guiding someone harshly in order for them to learn, the character will have to go against their kind nature and do what they have to do for the sake of doing what’s right. The character will not enjoy this at all. This may cause other characters to hate and resent the hero for making tough decisions that he is morally obligated to do.
•	Redemption: A character realizing that Being Evil Sucks will turn to the side of good, only to find out that it comes at a price since Redemption Equals Affliction. This means the character has to put aside their ego and acknowledge that they are in the wrong, accept their karmic punishment, and work hard to regain the trust and respect from others, even if people aren’t willing to forgive or at least forget what they’ve done.
•	Giving up on a Love Interest, so that they can be truly happy with someone else, or somewhere else, or doing something else. You may end up with someone else…or you may end up a Celibate Hero or dead.
•	Giving up some comfort because someone else has a Greater Need Than Mine.
•	Saving people, even if they don’t deserve it. Whether the person in need of saving is The Bully, Alpha Bitch, a group of characters who hate and mistreat the hero, or even the villain, the hero must suck it up and lend a hand to his enemies and rivals, and refusing to save them and let them suffer their fate is a huge no no. It doesn’t matter if they continue to show him zero respect after being saved, the hero must keep on saving them whether they like it or not.
•	Achieving a goal by doing things the honorable way. By honorable, we mean that the character must understand that Evil Is Easy, and he must work at the crack of dawn, avoid taking shortcuts, avoid the temptation of doing things that would jeopardize their morals as well as the people around them, and declining any offer of success given to them all in the name of hard work.
At times, it can lock characters into Status Quo Is God, where success requires an evil action, making winning and staying good impossible.
On the other side of the fence, this crops up when Evil Feels Good. Often applies to a Heel–Face Turn character, or a hero who laments that they have to save somebody they hate from a burning building, or they don’t get to kill their most hated enemy, because that’s the “heroic” decision.
In a Crapsack World, this trope applies to a great degree but being anything in such a world generally sucks.
Contrast Being Evil Sucks. Also, see Downer Ending, or, if you’re lucky, Earn Your Happy Ending. Compare No Good Deed Goes Unpunished, where the good action (rather than the process of being good) is what gets the characters in trouble. May result in someone expressing Sympathy for the Hero. Contrast Karma Houdini Warranty, where trying to turn over a new leaf can bring down heaven’s wrath. This is one way people become an Iron Woobie or a Knight In Sour Armor, depending on whether the suffering is taken with quiet dignity or grumpy complaining. This belief is the original mentality of a Moral Pragmatist before a Heel–Face Turn or someone tries to Cut Lex Luthor a Check, but they may wind up here again if they’re proven right.
There are many instances in real life in which being ‘good’ doesn’t suck that much. Scientifically, deeds perceived as good - whether or not they are good - entail social recognition and approval, and bad deeds entail reprisal. Most villains or villainous groups might also view their actions as ‘good’ in some sense, however, and therefore it might be unclear that this counts as ‘good’ in the same sense as a story with an author-determined moral compass. Justice is one of the fundamental evolutionary imperatives that allows human society to function coherently; we may not all be saints, but we’re not all lawless murderers. Unless you’re a Villain with Good Publicity It’s usually more profitable to abide by society’s rules, and even in that case you could be best off being Affably Evil. However, the more you could influence perception in such a context, the less it would matter here whether or not you were evil. Of course, multiple societies might have different and often conflicting moral codes, even within their own confines; further, if people like Karl Marx (himself a ‘villain’ to some, but not all) are to be believed, the conflict within societies can sometimes be such as to give rise to fundamentally opposed forces and force recourse to struggle. Further, moral codes change over time, and this occasionally leads to conflicts between earlier morality and new trends. As a result, a simplistic application of the story-telling categories of ‘villains’ and ‘heroes’ from fiction to real life might be worth avoiding, when it comes to this trope.</Text>

            <Text>#### British North America

Prior to about 1760, north of Spanish Florida, the Appalachian Divide represented the boundary between British and French colonial possessions in North America. After the French &amp; Indian War, England sought to clarify the boundaries. Under the _British North America Act of 1771_, the Original Thirteen colonies were re-organized into six provinces. Each of the sections below discusses each province in a bit more detail.

When debating whether to let the colonies have representation, many feared that Americans would eventually outnumber the home country. The solution hit upon manipulated the colonial borders in an effort to create division within each colony. This is the similar solution employed IRL.

We group the historic Thirteen Colonies before introducing new territories carved out of the lands acquired from the French.

            <Title>1783-1815: French Troubles</Title>
            <Text>&gt; IRL: At the end of the Seven Years' War, England's strategy in the Treaty of Paris (1763) sought to deter France from start a fifth war. France, however, sought to use the treaty to give them time to rebuild and rearm. French diplomats believed that without France to keep the Americans in check, the colonists might attempt to revolt. The American Revolution was that much-desired revolt.[^paris-treaty-1763]
[^paris-treaty-1763]: Wikipedia. _Treaty of Paris (1763)_.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)

The negotiations between British North America and England and discovery of Toltec Technology blunted the American desire to revolt.

* 1783-1815 - French economy collapses due to Seven Year's War debt and speculation and takes the government with it. The French Revolution is a decade early, ends the same but with American participation in Europe.
* 1802-1815 - War between France and most of Europe. Ended by British &amp; American deployment of Toltec weaponry

The French economy struggles under reparations required in the Treaty of Paris (1763). The government gets caught up in various schemes to pay the debt that results in a popular uprising in 1783.

Napoleon is involved as a republican during the early stages of the struggle, and gains power as expected. England takes control of New Orleans when Napoleon moves on Spain, and keeps it. Napoleon sends troops in 1801, triggering the war between England and France &amp; Spain (the latter as a vassal to France).

This "Napoleonic War" is ended by British &amp; American deployment of Toltec weaponry in 1815. Napoleon is executed and a new French king is placed on the throne. This ends the French Troubles.

The Louisiana Territory is kept by England as compensation for the war, and to further safeguard English interest and control over Toltec artifacts.

### Low Culture, High Tech

*"The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite."*

While you don't need to know how a gun works to know how to use one, the society as a whole must be able to support the thinkers and builders of such a device for it to see widespread and sustained use. Not so when you have Low Culture High Tech; this is a faction, culture, or race that uses technology far in advance of their scientific and cultural knowledge, often for warfare.

Usually [this group has pirated the technology from someone else](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ETGaveUsWifi). It may be [Lost Technology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology) that they have recovered and use, often very sturdy, self-replicating lost tech that only requires raw materials be input, if even that. Or it could be a [Black Box](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox) tech that none of their existing machines can do without. There may instead be a group of "thinkers and builders" who use the primitives as shock troops or even as a [Slave Race](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace). It's also possible the tables are turned and the primitives have either taken the builders hostage or killed them all and taken all of their goodies (without bothering [with the instruction manual](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup)). If the original source of the tech is [Shrouded in Myth](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth), they may become a [Cargo Cult](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult).

Typically, the primitives will only use a fraction of the technology's potential and not know all of its abilities. At best they will be able to maintain the equipment without knowing how to repair it should a major malfunction happen. It's highly possible that the original creators, or a group with sufficiently advanced science (even just curiosity and a working knowledge of the scientific method), can pull the rug out from under these primitives by either confiscating, hacking, or better using their pirated tech against them.

It's worth noting that a civilization doesn't have to be at stone age or [Medieval](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture) levels of technology for this trope to apply. They just have to routinely use tech far in advance of their ability to comprehend. A story set in 21st century Earth could have this trope apply if the planet were given [Imported Alien Phlebotinum](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum). Even space faring peoples can have [Low Culture, High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech) if they use stuff they don't understand.

Lastly, we want to draw attention to the following from the first paragraph "far in advance of their scientific and **cultural** knowledge". It's important to point out that not only are they using things they don't understand technologically, but for which they haven't considered the cultural, social, or ethical ramifications. It's one thing to give a hunter-gatherer society an [Energy Bow](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBow), but giving them a cloning device? Their society may crumble from the onset of massive [Cloning Blues](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues), not to mention the ecological disaster of the massive population growth. It's because of this that many aliens (and future humanity) tend to subscribe to an [Alien Non-Interference Clause](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause) or a [You Are Not Ready](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady) attitude.

Related to [Insufficiently Advanced Alien](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufficientlyAdvancedAlien), which is about a race that's interstellar, but every other tech they have sucks comparatively, *and* they probably don't understand it. Compare [Crystal Spires and Togas](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas). Contrast [Rock Beats Laser](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser). The [Noble Savage](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage) inverts this trope, being essentially High Culture, Low Tech. See also [Bamboo Technology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology), [Aliens Never Invented the Wheel](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel), [Scavenger World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld), [Giving Radio to the Romans](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingRadioToTheRomans), [Technology Uplift](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift) and [Cargo Cult](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult). Not to be confused with "[High Tech and Low Life.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk)" Compare [Klingon Scientists Get No Respect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect), when a society undervalues the profession that make its desired lifestyle possible. Not to be confused with [No Tech but High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTechButHighTech).

When adding [Real Life](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife) examples, please use the [Rule of Cautious Editing Judgment](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment) to avoid [Unfortunate Implications](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications).

### Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness

[Speculative Fiction][mwMx33wj] fanatics are always raving about how "hard" the science is in various stories — but it's not like you can rub *a story* with a piece of quartz and see if it leaves a scratch on *the plot*. So what is "hardness" in SF? Why do some people want it? And [how do we put a number to it][NOkAqidf]?

Beginning with the first question: "Hard" [Science Fiction][sgdWS6mo] is firmly grounded in reality, with only a few fantastic flights of fancy not justified by science, or with the technology being nonexistent in today's world but probably scientifically possible at some point. "Soft" [Sci-Fi][LXajJBEF] is more flexible on the rules. Even the fantastical aspects of the story will show a divide — in hard SF, they operate through strict, preferably physical, laws, where in soft SF they work in whatever way suits the story best. What this leads to for hard SF is a raised bar for the amount of scientific research the writer must put into the story, and usually [this is shown quite clearly][8HrNu5Wn].

Example: a character is shown a time machine and asks, "How does it work?"

- **In soft SF:** "You sit in this seat, set the date you want, and pull that lever."
- **In hard SF:** "A good question with an interesting answer. [Please have a seat while I bring you up to speed][8iQ04sci] on the latest ideas in quantum theory, after which I will spend a chapter detailing an elaborate, yet plausible-sounding connection between quantum states, the unified field theory, and the means by which the brain stores memory, all tied into theories from both [Albert Einstein][3qaD956S] [and][dfsz3JLW] [Stephen Hawking][LDQ3wJFW]."
- **In really hard SF:** "It doesn't. Time travel to the past is impossible."

Unfortunately for analytical purposes, this pattern is not universal - hard SF stories can skip over the details as long as the basic explanation is correct [given what's been established so far][j1PwGhT3]. Therefore, regardless of the [typical stylistic flourishes][Ucn7wU8t] ("If all stories were written like science fiction stories" by Mark Rosenfelder, a [conlanger][JF4OIW6e]) of hard SF, the only way to define it is self-consistency and scientific accuracy.

Which leads us to the Scale.

#### 1. [Science in Genre Only][IWwAmgHC]

The work is unambiguously set in the *literary genre* of [Science Fiction][sgdWS6mo], but *scientific* it is not. [Applied Phlebotinum][Tr5Te8RN] is the rule of the day, often of the [Nonsensoleum][xTPfjVyz] kind, [Green Rocks][MHJRQ0qR] gain [New Powers as the Plot Demands][pmKfr4nv], and both [Bellisario's Maxim][0Zf3RquH] and the [MST3K Mantra][PuIc3GLg] apply. Works like *[Futurama][0ABzsOm6]*, *[Star Wars][gMEIAaq9]*, *[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann][G7CIHgW1]*, The [DC][jIFoUr2L] and [Marvel][Ug9gAKAB] universes, and *[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy][fIoWDzmF]* fall in this class.

#### 2. [World of Phlebotinum][ZitMy4xA]

The universe is full of [Applied Phlebotinum][Tr5Te8RN] with more to be found behind every star, but the Phlebotinum is dealt with in a [fairly consistent fashion despite its lack of correspondence with reality][j1PwGhT3] and, in-world, is considered to lie within the realm of scientific inquiry. Works like [E. E. “Doc” Smith][4bS5N9zc]'s *[Lensman][Ye3kacUV]* series, *[Neon Genesis Evangelion][uNkklZWO]*, *[Star Trek: The Original Series][cQ3sVlht]*, and *[StarCraft][BQi0XVUl]* fall in this category. A subclass of this class (arguably 2.5 on the scale) contains stories that are generally sound, except the physics aren't our own. Plot aside, they are often a philosophical exploration of a concept [no longer considered true][FxcUSmAI] (such as [Aristotelian physics][IXqHfdLt]), or never considered true in the first place (e.g. two spatial dimensions instead of three, like *[Flatland][QA9xuupk]*). Some of [Arthur C. Clarke][LuigRHmY]'s stories fall here. However, given [the overlap with fantasy][yV3kzfoj], it can [prove tricky][2u7p0y5r] to even classify a story as SF.

#### 3. [Physics Plus][xhoAtoth]

Stories in this class once again have multiple forms of [Applied Phlebotinum][Tr5Te8RN], but in contrast to the prior class, the author aims to justify these creations with [real][8HrNu5Wn] and [invented][T1W79pRq] natural laws — and these creations and others from the same laws will [turn up again and again in new contexts][sfG5JATf]. Works like *[Schlock Mercenary][tLhDCzX3]*, [David Weber][26IsXwtN]'s *[Honor Harrington][0acypL0W]* series, David Brin's *[Uplift][tckHMq15]* series, and *[Battlestar Galactica (2003)][33D2GErh]* fall in this class. Most [Real Robot][lSpdYpyW] shows fall somewhere between Classes 2 and 3.

#### 4. [One Big Lie][11K1XHYU]

Authors of works in this class invent one (or, at most, a very few) counterfactual physical laws and writes a story that explores the implications of these principles. James Blish's *[Cities in Flight][kORNsz1m]* stories fall squarely into this category, courtesy of the "Dirac Equations" leading to the "spindizzy motor" and instantaneous communication. Most works in [Alan Dean Foster][ZPlP4YWe]'s *[Humanx Commonwealth][zgYlUwag]* series, the Ad Astra board games and [Robert A. Heinlein][cRNC2Ulg]'s *[Farnham's Freehold][mQxkQBuo]* fall in this category, as do many of [Vernor Vinge][Z5at8M5n]'s books. This class also includes a subclass (4.5 on the scale) we call *One Small Fib*, containing stories that include only a single counterfactual device (often [FTL Travel][RY9uZfJ6]), but for which the device is not a major element of the plot. Many [Hal Clement][zZhSFO0c] novels (e.g. *[Mission of Gravity][f3I5yyS7]*, *Close to Critical*) and *[Freefall][yYcu3X3p]* fall within the subclass.

#### 5. [Speculative Science][RyMR1kcA]

Stories in which there is no "big lie" — the science of the tale is (or [was][FxcUSmAI]) genuine speculative science or engineering, and the goal of the author to make as few errors with respect to known fact as possible. The first two books in [Robert L. Forward][Z8Pbpsnw]'s *Rocheworld* series and [Robert A. Heinlein][cRNC2Ulg]'s *[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress][wJFvPxb6]* fall in this class. A subclass of this (5.5 on the scale) is *Futurology:* stories which function almost like a prediction of the future, extrapolating from current technology rather than inventing major new technologies or discoveries. (Naturally, [Zeerust][7FovX6em] is common in older entries.) *[Gattaca][FyEVsPqa]*, *[Planetes][I8jG2OnX]*, *[Transhuman Space][v2Qt2MMA]* and the more [Speculative Fiction][mwMx33wj] works of [Jules Verne][hMEAMp1L] fall in this subclass.

#### 6. [Real Life][6gaGmntY] (aka Fiction in Genre Only)

A [Shared Universe][23KUZ3Pv] which spawned its own genre, known as "[Non-Fiction][FrHPeAI5]". Despite the various problems noted at [Reality Is Unrealistic][KHrsZjF1], it is almost universally agreed that there is no other universe known so thoroughly worked out from established scientific principles. [The Apollo Program][R8dvY1Hk], [World War II][wKkRPoT0], [and][so6WtNCv] [Woodstock][koLeSr2p] fall in this class.

            <Text>NIJ Ballistic Levels Protection

( Level IIA, Level II, Level IIIA, Level III and Level IV)

Body armor is a critical safety piece of safety equipment that has saved the lives of thousands of people. However people who are in the market for body armor often find it difficult to assess which choice is right for them. There are a few primary factors to consider which solution will best suit their needs; threat level, heat buildup, comfort, mobility conceal-ability and cost. Threat level or protection level is typically the biggest factor when choosing body armor, and also the most difficult aspect to understand.

The U.S. National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has established and updated minimum performance stands for body armor to ensure that users will know what their body armor will protect them from. The NIJ classifies body armor into 5 different threat levels:

Level IIA, Level II, Level IIIA, Level III and Level IV; based on their ability to stop specified rounds at specified velocities. The current standard is NIJ 101.06. Also please note that while a higher level generally means protection against more powerful rounds, it does not account for other factors such as weight, or multi-hit capability. Because of this it is suggested that you choose body armor that is right for the situation and not the one that is the highest level.

 NIJ Level IIA

NIJ Level IIA armor is typically soft body armor, meaning that it is composed of layers of high-strength woven fibers. Common types of these fibers are aramid fibers such as Kevlar, Twaron, and Goldflex or Polyethylene fibers such as Spectra and Dyneema. Level IIA is designed to stop a .9mm FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) round at a speed of ~1165 feet per second (ft/s) and a .40 S&amp;W FMJ at 1065 ft/s. Most often found in soft body armor vests, Level IIA is usually the lightest, most flexible, most comfortable and easiest to conceal.

 NIJ Level II

A step above Level IIA is Level II which is also most commonly soft body armor. Level II is designed to protect from .9mm FMJ traveling at a speed of ~1245 ft/s and a .357 Magnum JSP (Jacketed Soft Point) at ~1,430 ft/s. Like IIA, Level II body armor is typically very light, comfortable and easy to conceal, however it provides significantly more protection against blunt force trauma (trauma caused by kinetic energy of the round hitting the plate or vest.) Because of this factor most concealable body armor vests are either Level II or Level IIIA, with Level IIA falling largely out of date.

 NIJ Level IIIA

Level IIIA is designed to stop .357 Sig FMJ FN (Flat Nose) bullets traveling at a velocity of ~1470 ft/s and .44 Magnum SJHP (Semi Jacketed Hollow Point) rounds at a velocity of 1430 ft/s. Like its level IIA and Level II, Level IIIA is most commonly soft armor, however hard armor plates and ballistic shields can sometimes be found with a rating of level IIIA.

 NIJ Level III

At level III, we transition to soft body armor vests to the world of ballistic plate levels. Ballistic body armor plates are also referred to as rifle plates or hard armor plates. Level III rifle plates are designed to stop 6 spaced hits of 7.62x51mm NATO FMJ (U.S. Military designation M80) at a velocity of ~2780 ft/s, which is very similar to the .308 Winchester round often used in hunting. Some manufacturers (ourselves included) also offer hard armor rifle plates that are referred to as level III+. While the NIJ does not recognize the rating of level III+, these plates typically have the + to indicate that they stop the same rounds at higher velocities or to indicate protect from NIJ threat level III plus additional threats such as M855 and M193. Level III and III+ body armor plates can be found at a variety of different price points depending on the rifle plate’s weight and material. The cheapest and heaviest of these options are typically steel body armor plates which can weigh anywhere from 8-10 lbs depending on the size of the plate. While more expensive options such as those made from Polyethylene or ceramic, can weigh as little as 3 pounds.

 NIJ Level IV

Level IV ballistic plates are the highest rated hard armor plates under NIJ 101.06 standards. These hard armor plates were designed to take 1 hit from an armor-piercing rifle. These rifle plates are tested to defeat 7.62MM armor piercing (AP) bullets (also known was .30-06 or 30 ot 6) traveling at a velocity of 2880 ft/s. Please note that since level IV ballistic plates are only tested to stop 1 shot compared to 6 shots from a level III hard armor plate, a level IV hard armor plate is not always better than a level III hard armor plate. Besides NIJ certification there are other standards of bullet resistance such as the U.S. Military’s SAPI (Small Arms Protective Insert) standards, which features plates designed to military specifications. This standard first came into play with their Interceptor body armor (IBA), and later with their Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) and the Modular Tactical Vest (MTV). Since 2005, they have moved to the ESAPI (Enhanced SAPI) Program. There are also what are referred to as Special Threats plates which are designed to stop common threats while minimizing weight and cost. Typically examples of these plates are AK-47 and AR-15 plates.

            <Title>Central Theme</Title>
            <Text>Central Theme
Stories were first told for two reasons: entertainment and education. The Epic of Gilgamesh was the story of a hero who kicked ass and took names, but it was also a celebration of the culture that produced it, one of the first.
Different from An Aesop in that the Central Theme is often a question or a general topic rather than a direct precept or conclusion: where an Aesop is a specific moral that is explicated and forced on the audience, a Central Theme will more likely be explored, analyzed, and Played With. For example, “The Power of Friendship” or (even better) “The struggles of sustaining The Power of Friendship in a cold, harsh world” are themes in that they are questions or issues that the author is interested in exploring and/or wants the reader to think about, whereas “The Power of Friendship will ultimately overcome all obstacles” is an Aesop in that it is a lesson or conclusion the author wants the reader to take away from the work. Of course, there can be a fine line between them, and the central theme can and often is used to develop and deliver the Aesop, but they are not strictly speaking the same.
Using our example above as a demonstration, the writer may have constructed a story that examines the difficulties of sustaining The Power of Friendship in a cold, harsh world (theme), only to ultimately reach the conclusion that The Power of Friendship will always prevail (Aesop). The reader may disagree with the author’s conclusion, but regardless, the work will still be about the difficulties of sustaining The Power of Friendship, and there’s nothing the reader can do to change that.
Put simply, the Aesop is the what the author wants the reader to learn. The Central Theme is what the story is fundamentally about.
Also compare Motif, a more general term for a recurring symbol or idea throughout a work, different from Central Theme in that it is not the story’s main focus. Another distinction is that a Central Theme is usually a broad, expansive topic—love, time, mortality—while Motifs are generally smaller and more specific.
A good place to start thinking about the theme of the work is the conflict it depicts; what is the overall conflict of the story, where does it originate, and what questions or thinking points does this conflict prompt?
Go to a work’s Analysis sub-page to find a more detailed exploration of its central theme — or add your own insight. As always, however, be wary of seeing messages where there are none.</Text>

            <Text>### Overview

&lt;!-- format-overview --&gt;
**Strand** is a novella series broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 8--10 novellas as "chapters." This follows the [UK drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) or [Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) series season length. (See [research](research/season-episode.md))

**Pattern.** Seasons follow three intertwined storylines: combat, espionage/technology and diplomacy.

* Combat - this storyline deals with the use of force.
* Espionage - this storyline deals with exploration and theft of the ancient technology by various factions.
* Diplomacy - this storyline addresses changes in sectarian and international politics.

**Reading Length.** A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel. (See Audience) Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but the storylines will either be incomplete or hinting at the future.
&lt;!-- /format-overview --&gt;

### Reading Analysis

  - Each novella episode comprises 8 three-scene segments; 24 sections  (~1250 words per section).
  - Each scene services a different storyline, with three storylines per episode.
  - Thus, each storyline comprises eight segments, which while integrated are otherwise standalone.
* Reading Length
  - Reading pace: Average adult reading time is 220 wpm.[^reading]
  - Therefore, each novella should take about 2 1/2 hours to read ± 10%
* Listening Length
  - Listening pace: Audible standard voice pace is 150 wpm.[^listening]
  - A novella should complete in about 3 1/2 hours, which should be long enough to support one-leg if a flight.
  - A season should complete in about 33 hours, which should be enough to entertain a trucker for a week.

### Season Pattern

The following is the season pattern, as well as the per-episode structure.

1. **Stasis** - Everyday life, ends with inciting incident
2. **Trigger** - Beyond control triggers the story
3. **Quest Fail 1-3**
4. **Quest Fail 2**
5. **Quest Fail 3**
6. **Surprise** - Something unexpected to reader and character ruins the quest.
7. **Critical Choice** - Character makes a decision that reveals the character's true nature
8. **Defeat / Climax** - Critical choice leads to the darkest moment.
9. **Reversal** - Character reverses behavior as a result
10. **Resolution** - New stasis.

We plot the episodes in order: 10, 1, 6, 2-5, 9, 7, 8.

### Episode Pattern

* **Trio Pattern.** Each episode comprises three storylines where each storyline comprises eight segments.
  - Combat covers the tactical, human conflict (with blood as necessary).
  - Diplomacy engages the world changing political, social aspects of the divergence.
  - Stealth brings in the back-stabbing, conniving element, which is tied to either Combat or Diplomacy.

History of Forbes Road

Forbes Road (1758) - A military road established in 1758 under the Direction of British Brigadier General John Forbes during the French &amp; Indian War. The road connected Carlisle Barracks in central Pennsylvania with Forbes military objective, the French Fort Duquesne, in present day Pittsburgh. Fort Duquesne was very important because it was located at the strategic junction of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River where they become the Ohio River.
British Major General Edward Braddock had previously attempted to capture Fort Duquesne by cutting a road from Virginia. Braddock was defeated by the French 10 miles east of Fort Duquesne with heavy losses and Braddock himself was mortally wounded and died four days after the battle.
The new Forbes Road followed some existing trading routes known as the Raystown Path, or Old Trading Path, widened to accommodate wagons. He did not use any of the road Braddock had cut. At strategic points Forbes placed Forts to protect the supply lines and hold stores of equipment and men.
The primary obstacle along the road was the Appalachian Mountain range which formed a series of steep ridges in the path of the road. The British engineers completed the road in November 1758 and General Forbes marshaled troops and supplies at his base of operations at Fort Ligonier for the attack on Fort Duquesne. The French tested the defenses along the road and at Fort Ligonier and found them too strong for their forces. They then decided to abandon Fort Duquesne and they burned it to the ground. Forbes entered Fort Duquesne on 25 Nov 1758 and found a smoldering ruin.
Over the next several years the British built a larger Fort Pitt over the site of Fort Duquesne. The road built by Forbes provided an important route that helped to open up western Pennsylvania to settlement.

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) is a system for assigning coordinates to locations on the surface of the Earth. Like the traditional method of latitude and longitude, it is a horizontal position representation, which means it ignores altitude and treats the earth as a perfect ellipsoid. However, it differs from global latitude/longitude in that it divides earth into 60 zones and projects each to the plane as a basis for its coordinates. Specifying a location means specifying the zone and the x, y coordinate in that plane. The projection from spheroid to a UTM zone is some parameterization of the transverse Mercator projection. The parameters vary by nation or region or mapping system.

Most zones in UTM span 6 degrees of longitude, and each has a designated central meridian. The scale factor at the central meridian is specified to be 0.9996 of true scale for most UTM systems in use.[1][2]

History[edit]
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website states that the system was developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, starting in the early 1940s.[3] However, a series of aerial photos found in the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv (the military section of the German Federal Archives) apparently dating from 1943–1944 bear the inscription UTMREF followed by grid letters and digits, and projected according to the transverse Mercator,[4] a finding that would indicate that something called the UTM Reference system was developed in the 1942–43 time frame by the Wehrmacht. It was probably carried out by the Abteilung für Luftbildwesen (Department for Aerial Photography). From 1947 onward the US Army employed a very similar system, but with the now-standard 0.9996 scale factor at the central meridian as opposed to the German 1.0.[4] For areas within the contiguous United States the Clarke Ellipsoid of 1866[5] was used. For the remaining areas of Earth, including Hawaii, the International Ellipsoid[6] was used. The World Geodetic System WGS84 ellipsoid is now generally used to model the Earth in the UTM coordinate system, which means current UTM northing at a given point can differ up to 200 meters from the old. For different geographic regions, other datum systems can be used.

Prior to the development of the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system, several European nations demonstrated the utility of grid-based conformal maps by mapping their territory during the interwar period. Calculating the distance between two points on these maps could be performed more easily in the field (using the Pythagorean theorem) than was possible using the trigonometric formulas required under the graticule-based system of latitude and longitude. In the post-war years, these concepts were extended into the Universal Transverse Mercator/Universal Polar Stereographic (UTM/UPS) coordinate system, which is a global (or universal) system of grid-based maps.

The transverse Mercator projection is a variant of the Mercator projection, which was originally developed by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator, in 1570. This projection is conformal, which means it preserves angles and therefore shapes across small regions. However, it distorts distance and area.

Definitions[edit]
UTM zone[edit]

Simplified view of contiguous US UTM zones, projected with Lambert conformal conic.
The UTM system divides the Earth into 60 zones, each 6° of longitude in width. Zone 1 covers longitude 180° to 174° W; zone numbering increases eastward to zone 60, which covers longitude 174°E to 180°. The polar regions south of 80°S and north of 84°N are excluded.

Each of the 60 zones uses a transverse Mercator projection that can map a region of large north-south extent with low distortion. By using narrow zones of 6° of longitude (up to 668 km) in width, and reducing the scale factor along the central meridian to 0.9996 (a reduction of 1:2500), the amount of distortion is held below 1 part in 1,000 inside each zone. Distortion of scale increases to 1.0010 at the zone boundaries along the equator.

In each zone the scale factor of the central meridian reduces the diameter of the transverse cylinder to produce a secant projection with two standard lines, or lines of true scale, about 180 km on each side of, and about parallel to, the central meridian (Arc cos 0.9996 = 1.62° at the Equator). The scale is less than 1 inside the standard lines and greater than 1 outside them, but the overall distortion is minimized.

Overlapping grids[edit]

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Grid Zones 31N thru 37N differ from the standard 6° wide by 84° zone for the northern hemisphere, in part to accommodate the southern half of the Kingdom of Norway. For more on its history, see Clifford J. Mugnier's article on Grids &amp; Datums of The Kingdom of Norway that appeared in the October 1999 issue of PE&amp;RS http://www.asprs.org/a/resources/grids/10-99-norway.pdf
Distortion of scale increases in each UTM zone as the boundaries between the UTM zones are approached. However, it is often convenient or necessary to measure a series of locations on a single grid when some are located in two adjacent zones. Around the boundaries of large scale maps (1:100,000 or larger) coordinates for both adjoining UTM zones are usually printed within a minimum distance of 40 km on either side of a zone boundary. Ideally, the coordinates of each position should be measured on the grid for the zone in which they are located, but because the scale factor is still relatively small near zone boundaries, it is possible to overlap measurements into an adjoining zone for some distance when necessary.

Latitude bands[edit]
Latitude bands are not a part of UTM, but rather a part of the military grid reference system (MGRS).[7] They are however sometimes used.

Latitude bands[edit]
Each zone is segmented into 20 latitude bands. Each latitude band is 8 degrees high, and is lettered starting from "C" at 80°S, increasing up the English alphabet until "X", omitting the letters "I" and "O" (because of their similarity to the numerals one and zero). The last latitude band, "X", is extended an extra 4 degrees, so it ends at 84°N latitude, thus covering the northernmost land on Earth.

Latitude bands "A" and "B" do exist, as do bands "Y" and "Z". They cover the western and eastern sides of the Antarctic and Arctic regions respectively. A convenient mnemonic to remember is that the letter "N" is the first letter in "northern hemisphere", so any letter coming before "N" in the alphabet is in the southern hemisphere, and any letter "N" or after is in the northern hemisphere.

Notation[edit]
The combination of a zone and a latitude band defines a grid zone. The zone is always written first, followed by the latitude band. For example, (see image, top right), a position in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, would find itself in zone 17 and latitude band "T", thus the full grid zone reference is "17T". The grid zones serve to delineate irregular UTM zone boundaries. They also are an integral part of the military grid reference system.

A note of caution: A method also is used that simply adds N or S following the zone number to indicate North or South hemisphere (the easting and northing coordinates along with the zone number supplying everything necessary to geolocate a position except which hemisphere). However, this method has caused some confusion since, for instance, "50S" can mean southern hemisphere but also grid zone "50S" in the northern hemisphere.[8] There are many possible ways to disambiguate between the two methods, two of which are demonstrated later in this article.

Exceptions[edit]
These grid zones are uniform over the globe, except in two areas. On the southwest coast of Norway, grid zone 32V (9° of longitude in width) is extended further west, and grid zone 31V (3° of longitude in width) is correspondingly shrunk to cover only open water. Also, in the region around Svalbard, the four grid zones 31X (9° of longitude in width), 33X (12° of longitude in width), 35X (12° of longitude in width), and 37X (9° of longitude in width) are extended to cover what would otherwise have been covered by the seven grid zones 31X to 37X. The three grid zones 32X, 34X and 36X are not used.

Locating a position using UTM coordinates[edit]
A position on the Earth is given by the UTM zone number and the easting and northing planar coordinate pair in that zone. The point of origin of each UTM zone is the intersection of the equator and the zone's central meridian. To avoid dealing with negative numbers, the central meridian of each zone is defined to coincide with 500000 meters East. In any zone a point that has an easting of 400000 meters is about 100 km west of the central meridian. For most such points, the true distance would be slightly more than 100 km as measured on the surface of the Earth because of the distortion of the projection. UTM eastings range from about 167000 meters to 833000 meters at the equator.

In the northern hemisphere positions are measured northward from zero at the equator. The maximum "northing" value is about 9300000 meters at latitude 84 degrees North, the north end of the UTM zones. In the southern hemisphere northings decrease southward from the equator, set at 10000000 meters, to about 1100000 meters at 80 degrees South, the south end of the UTM zones. For the southern hemisphere, its northing at the equator is set at 10000000 meters so no point has a negative northing value.

The CN Tower is at 43°38′33.24″N 79°23′13.7″W, which is in UTM zone 17, and the grid position is 630084 m east, 4833438 m north. Two points in Zone 17 have these coordinates, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the south; one of two conventions is used to say which:

Append a hemisphere designator to the zone number, "N" or "S", thus "17N 630084 4833438". This supplies the minimum information to define the position uniquely.
Supply the grid zone, i.e., the latitude band designator appended to the zone number, thus "17T 630084 4833438". The provision of the latitude band along with northing supplies redundant information (which may, as a consequence, be contradictory if misused).
Because latitude band "S" is in the northern hemisphere, a designation such as "38S" is unclear. The "S" might refer to the latitude band (32°N–40°N) or it might mean "South". It is therefore important to specify which convention is being used, e.g., by spelling out the hemisphere, "North" or "South", or using different symbols, such as − for south and + for north.

Simplified formulae[edit]
These formulae are truncated version of Transverse Mercator: flattening series, which were originally derived by Johann Heinrich Louis Krüger in 1912.[9] They are accurate to around a millimeter within 3,000 km of the central meridian.[10] Concise commentaries for their derivation have also been given.[11][12]

The WGS 84 spatial reference system describes Earth as an oblate spheroid along north-south axis with an equatorial radius of

            <Text>#### Faster-than-Light Travel Physics via Wormholes

Faster-than-light travel is possible via wormholes, known as Slipstreams. IRL, wormholes are a scientific conjecture, derived from the same equations that describe black holes. We cannot conceive of how to get to or use a wormhole. In **Strand**, however, wormholes are a convenient means of travel from one place to another. People traverse wormholes using a Jump drive, with each wormhole connecting between only two locations. Travel time is near instantaneous for the jumping ship and its occupants.

A Slipknot is the term used by Toltecs and adopted by English (Laufknoten in German, Trou de Biche (tru-de-beesh) in French, Hueco in Spanish, Orifício in Portuguese).

            <Title>Ephraim George Biggs</Title>
            <Text>Ephraim George Biggs is a blacksmith and an extremist Son of Liberty who wants nothing more than American independence. His goal is to use the weapons he finds to purge America of British control, but is confronted with needing them to thwart Pontiac’s Rebellion. He realizes protecting society is more important than his view of what that society should be.
Story: Ephraim killed a British officer and was found guilty, only to escape and flee to the edge of society seeking refuge with his brother. Jeffry refuses, but also gives him lead time to flee into the wilderness, where Ephraim is pursued by Indians and falls into the Temple. With advanced weapons in hand, he tries to get them to Sons of Liberty, only to be captured by Mortimer. When Pontiac’s Rebellion is known, he relents to his brother’s pressure to surrender the location of the temple (and take Mortimer &amp; militia there) to get more weapons to lift the seige of Ft. Pitt. In compensation, Mortimer lets Ephraim free by agreeing to say he was killed in the fighting. Ephraim decides to go to South Carolina under an assumed name, but murders &amp; robs Solomon Sharpe first.</Text>

Behind the Marker 

On May 24, 1750, Conrad Weiser found himself facing the loaded gun of Andrew Lycon, a Scots-Irish squatter on Indian-owned land in the Juniata Valley. Weiser, who had agreed to accompany colonial secretary Richard Peters and some local magistrates into this frontier region as their Indian interpreter, must have wondered what he had gotten himself into. Like the colonial officials he was working for, Weiser considered squatters such as Lycon backcountry riff-raff, troublemakers who stirred up hostilities with Indians and refused to cooperate with colonial authorities. If peace was going to be preserved on the Pennsylvania frontier, Lycon and his neighbors had to go.

 
"The German Bleeds and bears ye fur, 1764." Inset: A Narrative of...

Lycon saw things differently. From his perspective, Weiser and his party were tools of the Penn family, wealthy proprietors who lived in England and took no interest in the hard work or livelihoods of  frontier families who made Pennsylvania a prosperous colony. When told by these officials that he had better remove himself peaceably from this land, Lycon said, "He would shoot the first Man that dared to come nigher [nearer]." Someone in Weiser's party (the record does not say who) had the nerve to call Lycon's bluff, for "he was disarmed, convicted, and committed to the Custody of the Sheriff." His home was burned to the ground at the insistence of Indians who witnessed the encounter.

The influx of Scots-Irish settlers into the Pennsylvania backcountry in the mid-eighteenth century caused considerable tension with local Indians. In 1749 Iroquois chiefs meeting with Pennsylvania officials complained that trespassers were settling on land reserved for the Delaware and Shawnee Indians along the Juniata River and its tributary creeks.

 
John Buxton, Once Upon a Time.

Members of the Penn family, who hoped to profit from the eventual sale of these lands, were no more anxious to see squatters in this region than the Indians were. Therefore, in May 1750 the governor dispatched Indian agents Richard Peters and Conrad Weiser to evict the settlers there. Peters and Weiser recruited the help of fur trader George Croghan and several local magistrates before crossing the Susquehanna River at Harris' Ferry (modern Harrisburg). After joining with some local Iroquois, they crossed the Tuscarora Mountains and spent several days confronting the trespassers in their small communities, forcibly evicting some and burning their homes. One such confrontation gave the town of Burnt Cabins its name.

Some of the settlers confronted by Peters and Weiser objected to their treatment because the Penn family had encouraged them to settle there years earlier to assert Pennsylvanian possession of territory claimed by Maryland. Peters allowed them to stay until he received further instruction from the governor. Otherwise, the burning of the trespassers" cabins did little to forestall the tide of Scots-Irish emigrants crossing the Susquehanna. Just five months after their expedition across the Tuscarora Mountains, Peters wrote to Weiser that, "The People over the Hills are combin'd against the Government, [and] are putting in new Cropps and bid us Defiance."

The colonies of North and South Carolina were consolidated into the Province of Carolina. The boundary with George is the Savannah River with the two tributaries of the Savannah, the Tugaloo River and the Chattooga River, form the northernmost part of the border; consistent with the Original Timeline. The Northern border is along the 36°30' as identified by King Charles II, and runs to the Appalachian Divide; consistent with the Original Timeline.[^nc-va-boundary]

Canada encompasses all land North of the St. Lawrence, which includes the Hudson Bay area and Quebec (both separated by the Laurentian Divide). Also added is Prince Edward Island. Areas South of the St. Lawrence were ceded to New England.

The Quebecois were disenfranchised by the _Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769_ for nearly two generations.

            <Text>
Saturday November 20, N.S 1763. Ephraim wiped his brow. The long day’s work had taken its toll. Not as much as it had the first few weeks, but enough to assure him he would sleep well tonight. He grinded from apprentice into journeyman at his father’s smithy from the age of seven to seventeen. He knew his way around the shop. Had he kept at it, he would have become a master by 21.
It was grueling work, and his father wanted him to follow Jeffry’s lead and become an attorney. This despite Jeffry’s insistence that he study in Philadelphia, hoping to enter into Dr. Franklin’s society.
The last think Ephraim wanted was apprentice to an attorney. He refused. For years his father continued the pressure for Ephraim to not become a smith. All the while, he toiled at the forge. Years of persistance paid off. Ephraim agreed to enter the ministry. It took a few years to prepare, but by seventeen he was admitted to Yale College. Over the past three years, he filled his mind with divinity, and his muscles weakened.
O’brien daily reminded Ephraim why he should have stayed at Yale. Not that he could under the circumstances. He would not be welcome in Connecticut ever again. He put that out of his mind and finished cleaning the shop. The sun was nearly set and he had not finished. It had been this way for weeks. He only got rest on Sundays, and spent most of his time then asleep. O’brien was getting the most out of the bargain that he could. Ephraim’s income was limited to sleeping in the loft and foot from O’brien’s table.
Taking a short break Ephraim looked out to the road that led back to Shippensburg. He saw a man walking, followed by a beautiful black horse on its tether. The horse limped on its front left leg. Ephraim sighed. It would be nightfall before he finished.

He walked toward the man, shortening the distance. “Your horse. Bit of a limp?” His voice strained to speak though a dry mouth.
“I rode him across a stream a couple miles back. He slipped, and he’s been limping since.” The man was curt, his accent clearly English.
Ephraim took the lead and led the horse toward the shop’s lamp. Inspecting, he saw a piece of stone caught in the hoof. He patted the horse gently as he set the leg back. He picked a pair of pliers off the workbench. He returned to the horse and lifted the leg. The horse started to shuffle. “He’s worried. Calm him?”
The stranger moved up to the horse’s head and stroked him. The horse settled. Ephraim grabbed the stone with the pliers and gently pulled. The stone was wedged in worse than it looked. He shifted and braced the leg more firmly and tried with more muscle. After a couple minutes, the stone came out.
Ephraim looked at the stone. It was flat and narrow, the sort of shale that everything seemed to be made out of. He held it up to the rider. “Pretty big piece. He’s a tough one to walk as far as he did.” He dropped the stone and inspected the hoof. There was only slight damage.
“Whoever shoed your horse did a fine job. If you can manage to stay off of him for a few days, he should be fine. If you have to ride him, take it easy. Maybe wade across with him if you have to cross another stream?”
The rider pursed his lips. “Sure. How much?”
Ephraim shook his head. “No charge.”
“Is there somewhere I can rest?”
“There’s an old tavern a bit that way. Most people seem to pass here from Shippensburg and go to Getty’s ford and stay there.”
“How far is that?”
Ephraim shrugged. He turned to O’brien. “How far to Getty’s?”

“Getty’s? Why? That’s over the mountain.”
“Isn’t that where people go from Shippensburg?”
“No. Elizabethtown, down in Maryland. That’s about another day’s ride straight down the road.”
“Aren’t we in Maryland now?” the rider said.
“Depends on who’s asking. The Penns say Pennsylvania. The Calverts say Maryland. Colonel Chambers would prefer we were in Pennsylvania since he holds a land grant from them. That’s his.” O’brien pointed at the fort.
The rider studied O’brien and Ephraim. “It sounds like your Irish, old man. And you’re American.”
“Yes. From Philadelphia. Any reason?”
The rider shook his head. His voice derisive. “I could not imagine anyone working for the Irish. This continent perpetually amazes me.”
O’brien closed on the rider. “You’d better be off to the tavern now.”
Judging from the look of the rider, Ephraim knew if it came to blows between the Irish and English, O’brien would triumph. The scene faintly reminded him of New Haven.
The rider hesitated. “Forgive my manners. No offense intended. It has been a long day.”
Ephraim nodded.
The rider touched his hat the way Ephraim had seen redcoats. The rider took the horse’s lead and made for the tavern.
“Damned English. No matter where they go, they think they’re the master.”
“They are of us, for now.”
“Aye. I’ve heard that before. Here is farther from England than Cork, but not far enough.”
Ephraim chuckled, agreeing with the sentiment. “We’ll have to see what happens when this war ends.”
“If the last two are any indication, we’ll be in another one by 1780. They seem to happen with every new king. You’re young enough to see that one. I won’t. It would be great to be rid of the English, but I have no fondness for the French, Spanish or Indian.” O’brien sighed. His age showed more than Ephraim had noticed before. “At least there are a bunch of Germans around us. They seem content to be left alone. And the quakers are only trouble for them, not for me.” He clapped Ephraim on the shoulder. “Jeffry lad, you’ve done a fine job. You know your way around a shop nearly as well as I.”
“Thank you.”
“But you know there’s not a lot of work for the both of us.”
“Telling me to move on?”
“Not yet. Weather’s getting dank. I’ll let you stay on through the season.”
“You can stay in the loft, and I’ll pay you what I can. That should give you enough to press on into Virginia come.”</Text>

            <Title>Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness</Title>
            <Text>Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness
Speculative Fiction fanatics are always raving about how “hard” the science is in various stories — but it’s not like you can rub a story with a piece of quartz and see if it leaves a scratch on the plot. So what is “hardness” in SF? Why do some people want it? And how do we put a number to it?
Beginning with the first question: “Hard” Science Fiction is firmly grounded in reality, with only a few fantastic flights of fancy not justified by science, or with the technology being nonexistent in today’s world but probably scientifically possible at some point. “Soft” Sci-Fi is more flexible on the rules. Even the fantastical aspects of the story will show a divide — in hard SF, they operate through strict, preferably physical, laws, where in soft SF they work in whatever way suits the story best. What this leads to for hard SF is a raised bar for the amount of scientific research the writer must put into the story, and usually this is shown quite clearly.
Example: a character is shown a time machine and asks, “How does it work?”
•	In soft SF: “You sit in this seat, set the date you want, and pull that lever.”
•	In hard SF: “A good question with an interesting answer. Please have a seat while I bring you up to speed on the latest ideas in quantum theory, after which I will spend a chapter detailing an elaborate, yet plausible-sounding connection between quantum states, the unified field theory, and the means by which the brain stores memory, all tied into theories from both Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.”
•	In really hard SF: “It doesn’t. Time travel to the past is impossible.”
Unfortunately for analytical purposes, this pattern is not universal - hard SF stories can skip over the details as long as the basic explanation is correct given what’s been established so far. Therefore, regardless of the typical stylistic flourishes (“If all stories were written like science fiction stories” by Mark Rosenfelder, a conlanger) of hard SF, the only way to define it is self-consistency and scientific accuracy.
Which leads us to the Scale.
1. Science in Genre Only
The work is unambiguously set in the literary genre of Science Fiction, but scientific it is not. Applied Phlebotinum is the rule of the day, often of the Nonsensoleum kind, Green Rocks gain New Powers as the Plot Demands, and both Bellisario’s Maxim and the MST3K Mantra apply. Works like Futurama, Star Wars, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, The DC and Marvel universes, and The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy fall in this class.
2. World of Phlebotinum
The universe is full of Applied Phlebotinum with more to be found behind every star, but the Phlebotinum is dealt with in a fairly consistent fashion despite its lack of correspondence with reality and, in-world, is considered to lie within the realm of scientific inquiry. Works like E. E. “Doc” Smith’s Lensman series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Star Trek: The Original Series, and StarCraft fall in this category. A subclass of this class (arguably 2.5 on the scale) contains stories that are generally sound, except the physics aren’t our own. Plot aside, they are often a philosophical exploration of a concept no longer considered true (such as Aristotelian physics), or never considered true in the first place (e.g. two spatial dimensions instead of three, like Flatland). Some of Arthur C. Clarke’s stories fall here. However, given the overlap with fantasy, it can prove tricky to even classify a story as SF.
3. Physics Plus
Stories in this class once again have multiple forms of Applied Phlebotinum, but in contrast to the prior class, the author aims to justify these creations with real and invented natural laws — and these creations and others from the same laws will turn up again and again in new contexts. Works like Schlock Mercenary, David Weber’s Honor Harrington series, David Brin’s Uplift series, and Battlestar Galactica (2003) fall in this class. Most Real Robot shows fall somewhere between Classes 2 and 3.
4. One Big Lie
Authors of works in this class invent one (or, at most, a very few) counterfactual physical laws and writes a story that explores the implications of these principles. James Blish’s Cities in Flight stories fall squarely into this category, courtesy of the “Dirac Equations” leading to the “spindizzy motor” and instantaneous communication. Most works in Alan Dean Foster’s Humanx Commonwealth series, the Ad Astra board games and Robert A. Heinlein’s Farnham’s Freehold fall in this category, as do many of Vernor Vinge’s books. This class also includes a subclass (4.5 on the scale) we call One Small Fib, containing stories that include only a single counterfactual device (often FTL Travel), but for which the device is not a major element of the plot. Many Hal Clement novels (e.g. Mission of Gravity, Close to Critical) and Freefall fall within the subclass.
5. Speculative Science
Stories in which there is no “big lie” — the science of the tale is (or was) genuine speculative science or engineering, and the goal of the author to make as few errors with respect to known fact as possible. The first two books in Robert L. Forward’s Rocheworld series and Robert A. Heinlein’s The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress fall in this class. A subclass of this (5.5 on the scale) is Futurology: stories which function almost like a prediction of the future, extrapolating from current technology rather than inventing major new technologies or discoveries. (Naturally, Zeerust is common in older entries.) Gattaca, Planetes, Transhuman Space and the more Speculative Fiction works of Jules Verne fall in this subclass.
6. Real Life (aka Fiction in Genre Only)
A Shared Universe which spawned its own genre, known as “Non-Fiction”. Despite the various problems noted at Reality Is Unrealistic, it is almost universally agreed that there is no other universe known so thoroughly worked out from established scientific principles. The Apollo Program, World War II, and Woodstock fall in this class.

            <Text>Author’s Note

&lt;$month&gt;, &lt;$year&gt; Thank you for reading through to the end. I originally wrote and released Bellicose with no professional editing in 2013. I didn't know if anyone would want to read it. If you've seen the Amazon feedback before 2020, the story was decent but the editing lacking. While I started a revision in 2017, I let life get in the way---a new house, more education, work, family. I even started a new series hoping Bophendze could get some rest. He takes a lot of abuse to go from being a kid to a marine. The other series is an alternate history set in mid-18th Century North America. Let me know if you're interested in reading it?

But, Bophendze and Smee insisted on telling their story. This time I'm coming back with solid editing. I removed Smee's back story. It's now a short story you get when you sign up to the newsletter. I added Pijemio's storyline because a friend said the Navy didn't get fair billing. And, I added a hook for the next Bophendze adventure Luctation.

Faster-than-Light Travel Physics via Wormholes
Faster-than-light travel is possible via wormholes, known as Slipstreams. IRL, wormholes are a scientific conjecture, derived from the same equations that describe black holes. We cannot conceive of how to get to or use a wormhole. In Strand, however, wormholes are a convenient means of travel from one place to another. People traverse wormholes using a Jump drive, with each wormhole connecting between only two locations. Travel time is near instantaneous for the jumping ship and its occupants.
A Slipknot is the term used by Toltecs and adopted by English (Laufknoten in German, Trou de Biche (tru-de-beesh) in French, Hueco in Spanish, Orifício in Portuguese).
Neutrino Energy
Neutrino energy is a theoretical way of converting the kinetic energy of cosmic into into direct current (DC) electricity. The energy is converted by layers a conductive film, silicone film and graphene film. The conductive film comprises silver, gold, copper, gallium or aluminum or one of their alloys, in particular of a silver or gold alloy or an aluminum-gallium alloy. Each film layer is very fine, measured in 100s of nanometers. See Neutrino Power Cube[sec:neutrino-power-cube] for the scientific application.

The main (or core) population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, which are based on what is known as “Kirkwood gaps”. Named after Daniel Kirkwood, who announced in 1866 the discovery of gaps in the distance of asteroids, these gaps are similar to what is seen with Saturn’s and other gas giants’ systems of rings. https://www.notion.so/1f5ce610ebbb44d68c53e3d4c847c22d</Text>

### Crapsack World

No hope. No release. No end.

A Crapsack World is a horrible setting where the [jaded][ePTfNtdX] notion of "[anything that can go wrong][I3Ldx0jE] will go *horribly* wrong" almost always applies, and it corrupts its inhabitants into [perpetuating that nastiness against each other][1Sy0R36I]. More succinctly, trying to survive in one of these places [is gonna suck][Db2q9fwk].

Although there are countless ways Crapsack Worlds can be depicted (often with [Scenery Gorn][Hh9OorUp]), it is usually [dark][r8lLOVGL], and on the [cynical end][HKhdU7zQ] of the [Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism][IxUrvxaF], so it will have either [Grey and Gray Morality][wx6HoZB4] or [Black and Gray Morality][5wNVLRmr], if not outright [Evil vs. Evil][V1pefCi1] in the worst of cases (beware of [Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy][k12HagWl] if you decide to go this route though). Settings like these are not kind at all to [idealists][4oJl3Bdd], who usually get [traumatized][6q1GEDBT] and/or [die horribly][fLUU4loW] when their attempts to change the world through idealism meet tragic ends.

Heroes in this setting are usually [Anti Heroes][5yjINdme], and often have at least a bit of the [Deadpan Snarker][r1dVAyv9] about them. [Being good will suck][IE2XJflS], and if there are genuinely good heroes in this setting, expect them to be [Knights In Sour Armor][b8Jdn16A] and/or [Hurting Heroes][Yf865Gea]—more idealistic heroes such as the [Knight in Shining Armor][U5gJovm5] tend to not last long in this kind of setting. Any victories they manage to win over the forces of this world are likely to be [Pyrrhic][obn48Nic] in nature.

Villains tend to run the gamut from sympathetic [Anti Villains][lamexdTv] (on any level of the [Sliding Scale of Anti-Villains][nSNhRCAx]) right down to the most horrific monsters to grace any kind of media. Truly awful villains are especially common in these kinds of settings, both to represent the misery of the setting in general and to give the [Anti-Hero][5yjINdme] someone to whom he can look good in comparison. In truly extreme cases, even the most [popular][paEGHTXp] or powerful of these monsters [suffer just as badly as everyone else][bjT1r5tF]. And [Anyone Can Die][s7aV1krQ].

From here, these worlds can be depicted by authors in various ways, whether it would be dramatic or comedic, immutable or mutable. Though most of the time immutable equals dramatic, it is possible to see combinations between these categories.

- A *[dramatic][fpTmFono]* Crapsack World [has plenty][Nh1gHqHP] [of angst][3mx2ozb6] to go around, and often makes [Woobies][UxqARrDU] out of its sympathetic cast, particularly the protagonist, as they [suffer horribly][5cFuAeHk] in their attempts to do the right thing or pursue their dreams. Expect characters [who do the right thing][IE2XJflS] to [suffer for it][aGFWb63C]. Expect characters who do the wrong thing to prosper... and *[then][nGaALRCl]* [suffer][GkQxcKIy]. Examples: *[New World of Darkness][qlto3HxA]*, *[Old World of Darkness][tUKJEhnE]*, *[Sin City][9gxSPVBE]*, and *[Neon Genesis Evangelion][tdIq7bOf]*.
- A *[comedic][HoXGXFvn]* Crapsack World is [Played for Laughs][hNuFGE3r] and is made up of [idiots][6mrSMwvG], [jerks][IX7RcYGr], [Butt Monkeys][oByPkNKC], [Chew Toys][ICCLLLxv] and the occasional [Only Sane Man][5gdTwId7], with plenty of [Comedic Sociopathy][uoKomser] to go around. These include the [Black Comedy][7rTAsWtz], the [Sadist Show][PInb7WDM] and the [World Gone Mad][qLsnl5x5]. The "upside" is that it's usually [parodic][gHWpSDcA] and [funny in its extremes][tJhJHJlq]. Though people die left and right, it likely has [Negative Continuity][WPI1cSuF] to facilitate the inhabitants' suffering. Maybe a [Crapsaccharine World][VQH1YlHE]. Examples: *[Invader Zim][WHJQ2HZH]*, *[Ed, Edd n Eddy][VC8I7icF]*, *[Happy Tree Friends][jdNIQdAx]*, *[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show][XJEcoU5w]*, *[Rocko's Modern Life][S0469Z6Z]*, *[The Simpsons][G5JzEcIy]*, *[Family Guy][N3fCeesm]*, *[Matt 'n' Dusty][dGGZQ5H0]*, *[Drawn Together][WcfFqlMR]*, and *[South Park][Qs3hma9D]*. *[Paranoia][mGbJFuSQ]* is [not an example of this in the slightest.][adj5fHQm]
- An *[immutable][AkxGYLha]* Crapsack World has agony [Inherent in the System][MoBW0OXL], both physically and metaphysically, and cannot be saved or made a better place. Trying to break [The Corruption][MRdheCt2] [will instead always result][AkxGYLha] in [breaking every bone in your body][9UX3xioS] [and it winning][4y6KFlRi], and any positive changes that you try to make will ultimately be torn down and revealed to be [All for Nothing][kcPTxOAG]—or, even worse, they will only succeed in [making things even worse for you and the people that you were trying to help][P1dRVhMv], and/or [even accomplish whatever the villains wanted in the first place][sm8yYF5X]. Examples: *[Nineteen Eighty-Four][536rHcpl]*, *[Warhammer 40,000][fozFG4gj]*, *[FATAL][szNikQ0E]*, and the [Lovecraftian][DrzcDkfQ] [Fiction][ff12eY8g] genre in general.
- A *[mutable][4ZraWKYJ]* Crapsack World simply *starts out* as crappy, but a determined protagonist and his [True Companions][sYA2W3AY], be they the [Knight In Shining][U5gJovm5] (or in many of these cases, [Sour][DLryO6MZ]) [Armor][U5gJovm5] or a simple old PI, can actually cause some, but mostly few, [positive changes in the setting][lOMq0ooO]. See also [A World Half Full][Xzp0WJTE]. Examples: *[Elysium][UGJstHoE]*, *[Fallout][ctVSucoZ]*, *[Mad Max][nC02RxUk]*, and *[Waterworld][BQ2639tc]*.

This kind of world often occurs [After the End][PlDILvlz]. [Wretched Hive][MrPtsx8q] and [City Noir][sQ7ZfpwT] are city-sized versions of the Crapsack World. A [Dystopia][YfE1PWc2] is a speculative Crapsack World ruled by repressive forces modeled after real-life politics. A [Teenage Wasteland][HQBmkMUQ] is a Crapsack World run by kids. If the Crapsack World's continued misery is caused by supernatural forces, see [Dark Fantasy][qpQ3TOZ0], [Hell on Earth][hJ1pse1K] and [Cosmic Horror Story][ff12eY8g].

If a [Sugar Bowl][DUrwhASq] (usually the antithesis of this trope) turns out to be one of these under the surface, then you have yourself a [Crapsaccharine World][VQH1YlHE]. If the people who live in the Crapsack World don't realise or pretend it isn't a horrible place to be in, it is a [False Utopia][JkXIofsa]. A [Villain World][Lm8bSMWR] or [Death World][B69XJXuv] is likely to be this, and [Bad Future][rCIcFHBp] is a [Sub-Trope][bXIywgsd]. Someone who just thinks the world they inhabit is this is a [Cynic][ePTfNtdX] or a [Straw Nihilist][jx8Wr9X9] (or a [Grumpy Bear][QxKgk0Cz], if he lives in a pretty nice world).

For worlds that are almost literal sacks of crap see [The Dung Ages][PepVzKVG]. See [You Would Not Want to Live in Dex][Wm4VWN1r] for other crapsack environments. On a less negative note, the [World of Badass][iv2BaBxR] will also be likely to have elements of the Crapsack World, to give justification on why kicking ass is very important to survival. Compare [World of Jerkass][C9006hx2], a world which is only unpleasant because all of the characters are horrible people.

This trope is also known as World Half Empty, for the expression of pessimism being a state of seeing a glass with half the amount of water in it as being "half empty". Also, a half-empty glass means it can only be emptied, and can't be refilled. It represents [hopelessness][lfmHjIVr] [and inevitable doom][KjTsmpix], fitting this trope perfectly. By definition, contrast [A World Half Full][Xzp0WJTE]. [C.T. Phipps][4s0bjs10] talks about some of the appeal to the concept here. [The Appeal of Grimdark.][bYBCvbqb]

His goal in the story is to pave the way for Pontiac’s siege of Fort Pitt by hunting solitary white “spies.” He is confronted by Biggs’ access to weaponry, and realizes that those advanced weapons could spell the doom for the Iroquois nation.
Story: Kariwase hunts white hunters who find themselves in Iroquois territory as part of the preliminary action of Pontiac’s Rebellion. He prologs the series by killing a white savagely, eating brains per the start of the French &amp; Indian War. He later hunts Biggs who evades him by falling into a pit. He leaves a small team to ensure Biggs doesn’t escape, and is later enraged that they were killed by Biggs.

            <Text>##### Sons of Liberty

&gt; The Sons of Liberty was a secret organization that was created in the Thirteen American Colonies to advance the rights of the European colonists and to fight taxation by the British government. It played a major role in most colonies in battling the Stamp Act in 1765.

During the Point of Divergence, calmer heads prevailed, leading to successful redress of the Sons of Liberty grievances. A splinter group remained, led by Sam Adams &amp; John Brown. As part of the settlement, the violent Sons were identified by the Sons' leadership.

During the Discovery season, the Sons are actively hunted by a British organization led by Ephraim Lapham and John Tremain.

Those rebels who were arrested were put on trial, and most were found guilty of insurrection against the Crown---100 in total were convicted. They were punished either by death (if a leader) or transportation to Australia, which had replaced British America as a penal colony after the Reform in America Act of 1771. Public hanging took place in the Parliament House Square (seat of Parliament of North America, formerly the Pennsylvania State House, Independence Hall IRL).

&lt;!-- Synopsis: Biggs the rebel discovers advanced weaponry that he wants to use against the British when he is confronted with Pontiac's War.

Summary: Biggs is a former clergy who turned rabid anti-British patriot. He shows up at his brother's door while being pursued by Hunter, and flees when he finds his brother is Loyalist and turned him in, only to be chased by Indians and falls into a pit where he discovers advanced weaponry. He tries to smuggle the weapons back to his Sons of Liberty friends only to be exposed by a mole within the organization and sentenced to be hanged. Before the sentence could be carried out, Pontiac's War erupts and distracts the British, and Biggs decides to help the British against the Indians by giving up the weaponry which requires sneaking past the indians and then lifting the siege.

            <Title>Giving Radio to the Romans</Title>
            <Text>Giving Radio to the Romans
“…we now live in a world where kings and noblemen rule the roost. And they’ve turned all of central Europe — our home, now, ours and our childrens’ to come — into a raging inferno. We are surrounded by a Ring of Fire. Well, I’ve fought forest fires before. So have lots of other men in this room. The best way to fight a fire is to start a counterfire. So my position is simple. I say we start the American Revolution — a hundred and fifty years ahead of schedule!”
The problem with the past is that it’s so uncivilized, but any time traveler worth their salt can fix that. Just introduce it to the delights of modern technology, several centuries early. You may need to go through a few intermediate stages, replicating the history of technology on fast forward, but you know exactly what needs doing. How difficult can it be?
There are two types of time travelers who try this stunt - the unwilling ones, Trapped in the Past with just the right skills needed to jump start the industrial revolution, and the reckless ones who don’t care about paradoxes, they just want to rewrite history for the better.
Either way, this is a long term plan. Even optimistic heroes will expect to take a few years to get the desired results. Realistic ones will consider it a lifetime’s work. The hero can’t leap straight to modern technology; they have to get the past society to go through all the intermediate steps first, or they won’t have the necessary tools to make the tools to do the job. As such, this is typically the plot of an entire book, or even a series.
Ancient Astronauts and explorers rediscovering lost colonies occasionally fall into the trope, if the story goes into detail about how they introduce technological advances, but they normally gloss that over. By contrast, works in this subgenre typically go into great details about the new technologies being introduced to the past, and their social impact, as well as addressing all the problems that would realistically crop up.
If the strand party has a phone to a high-tech society, whether in the future or on another world, this trope can still apply. The phone can provide them with all the information they need, but they still have to deal with the immense practical problems involved in getting from medieval to modern technology. It would still take decades to get 14th century England from church bells to digital clocks, even with an internet connection to the present day, and the full resources of the kingdom at your disposal. However, if the strand party can get actual physical objects from their high-tech friends, the difficulties melt away, and this trope does not apply.
If a Hero succeeds, there’s still a risk of going horribly wrong, going horribly right, or both.
If the Hero went back in time with the purpose of using this trope to change history (such as preventing the Fall of Constantinople by going back to 1453 and giving the city’s defenders modern weaponry and teaching them modern tactics), then it also counts as trying to Set Right What Once Went Wrong (or Make Wrong What Once Went Right, depending on the perspective).
Fridge Logic would dictate that this would result in an infinite technological loop: Suppose the radio was invented back in 50 B.C. by a time traveler. Since this means that time travel is possible, eventually somebody from the future of the timeline created by the original time traveler would travel back to an even earlier time (for example, 800 B.C.) and give radio to the Akkadians or something. Then a time traveler from that timeline would introduce radio even father back, repeating until the very first generation of humans ever to evolve is given advanced technology and civilization.
Compare with:
•	A Little Something We Call “Rock and Roll”: When this is done with pop culture instead of technology.
•	Low Culture, High Tech: Will result if the time traveler doesn’t lay the groundwork for the low tech people to properly replicate the future tech.
Contrast with:
•	This Is My Boomstick: The Hero only wants to impress the locals short-term.
•	Cargo Cult: The primitive culture gets technology but concludes that the artifact is a god.</Text>

            <Title>Neutrino Energy</Title>
            <Text>Neutrino energy is a theoretical way of converting the kinetic energy of cosmic into into direct current (DC) electricity.
The energy is converted by layers a conductive film, silicone film and graphene film. The conductive film comprises silver, gold, copper, gallium or aluminum or one of their alloys, in particular of a silver or gold alloy or an aluminum-gallium alloy. Each film layer is very fine, measured in 100s of nanometers. See Neutrino Power Cube[sec:neutrino-power-cube] for the scientific application.

IRL Research:

* The neutrino is the source of abundant, clean, renewable energy.[^nutrino-energy]
* Neutrinovoltaic - a low voltage system of 12/24/48V DC
* Neutrino Film is "a film made of metal or a metal alloy, in particular a film made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a so-called neutrino or ntrino film (registered trademarks), to a method of production and to a use of a film made of metal or a metal alloy." [^WO2016142056A1]
* Neutrino Power Cubes are highly sophisticated power cells that have the advantage of being able to supply energy in complete darkness. They do this by harnessing the kinetic energy created by invisible waves of cosmic radiation, transforming it into micro-vibrations in a complex resonation process facilitated by super-symmetrical coatings on a stable substrate. And because these power cells can be stacked on top of one another, they are more compact and efficient than today’s solar cells and far less easily damaged.[^Neutrino-energy]
* Neutrino Energy Harvesting is when energy can be derived from many different sources such as radio waves, vibrations, heat, or light, and these sources can be either natural or artificial. Solar cells convert light; thermoelectric generators convert heat flux (temperature differences); and Neutrino Power Cubes convert vibrations caused by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos into electricity.[^Neutrino-Wiki]

            <Title>Five-Man Band</Title>
            <Text>Five-Man Band
Pictured: Everybody in the band.
The Five-Man Band is a group of characters whose members fall into archetypes which all complement one another. They are a very specific team with skills that contribute to the group in a way oddly analogous to the members of a rock band. It can sometimes literally be a musical group, but much more often is not.
The group traditionally includes:
•	The Leader — (lead singer) The leader of the group. Can be a mastermind, charismatic, levelheaded, headstrong, or some combination of the four. Often also The Hero.
•	The Lancer — (lead guitar) Usually a contrast to The Leader. If the Leader is clean-cut and/or uptight, the Lancer is a grizzled Anti-Hero or Deadpan Snarker; if the Leader is driven and somewhat amoral, the Lancer is more relaxed and level-headed.
•	The Smart Guy — (keyboardist) The physically weak, but intelligent or clever member. Often nerdy and awkwardly played for comic relief. Sometimes unconventionally young (early- to mid-teens). Sometimes The Trickster and a buddy of the Big Guy.
•	The Big Guy — (drummer) The strongman of the team. May be dumb. Or mute.
•	The Chick — (vocal effects, tambourine) A peacekeeping role to balance out the other members’ aggression, bringing them to a nice or at least manageable medium. The Chick is often considered the heart of the group. This role is played by a woman or girl. Someone female. Otherwise, it is not a Five-Man Band.
The five-man rock band phenomenon, four guys and a girl singer, is no longer as current as it once was. It was very hard to escape in the 60’s and 70’s. However, the group structure, as you will see in the examples, turns up in a lot of storytelling. Like a whole lot of storytelling.
See also ¡Three Amigos!, Power Trio, and Cast Calculus. Fighting ability is usually determined by Fixed Relative Strength. Compare the Command Roster, for military-esque teams. The Psycho Rangers are the collective Evil Counterpart of a given Five-Man Band. See also Four-Temperament Ensemble.
These are examples of teams that fit all five of the character tropes. Remember that they form a team dynamic; it’s always tempting to match two of the characters in a show, then try to convince yourself and others that the other characters can be squeezed/wedged/stuffed into the description of the other character types, but that’s not the point of the Five-Man Band trope. The individual character types exist outside of the band. The Five-Man Band only occurs when the team as a whole fits, not just a few characters.
As a rule of thumb, if your band example has to justify more than two types, or a single trope with more than two sentences of qualifiers, you’re trying to fool yourself. If it isn’t a Five-Man Band, it isn’t a Five-Man Band.</Text>

            <Text>The Founding of Pennsylvania
William Penn and the Quakers
Penn was born in London on October 24, 1644, the son of Admiral Sir William Penn. Despite high social position and an excellent education, he shocked his upper-class associates by his conversion to the beliefs of the Society of Friends, or Quakers, then a persecuted sect. He used his inherited wealth and rank to benefit and protect his fellow believers. Despite the unpopularity of his religion, he was socially acceptable in the king’s court because he was trusted by the Duke of York, later King James II. The origins of the Society of Friends lie in the intense religious ferment of seventeenth century England. George Fox, the son of a Leicestershire weaver, is credited with founding it in 1647, though there was no definite organization before 1668. The Society’s rejections of rituals and oaths, its opposition to war, and its simplicity of speech and dress soon attracted attention, usually hostile.
The Charter
King Charles II owed William Penn £16,000, money which his late father Admiral Sir Penn had lent him. Seeking a haven in the New World for persecuted Friends, Penn asked the King to grant him land in the territory between Lord Baltimore’s province of Maryland and the Duke of York’s province of New York. With the Duke’s support, Penn’s petition was granted. The King signed the Charter of Pennsylvania on March 4, 1681, and it was officially proclaimed on April 2. The King named the new colony in honor of William Penn’s father. It was to include the land between the 39th and 42nd degrees of north latitude and from the Delaware River westward for five degrees of longitude. Other provisions assured its people the protection of English laws and, to a certain degree, kept it subject to the government in England. Provincial statutes could be annulled by the King. In 1682 the Duke of York deeded to Penn his claim to the three lower counties on the Delaware, which are now the state of Delaware.
The New Colony
In April 1681, Penn made his cousin William Markham deputy governor of the province and sent him to take control. In England, Penn drew up the First Frame of Government, his proposed constitution for Pennsylvania. Penn’s preface to First Frame of Government has become famous as a summation of his governmental ideals. Later, in October 1682, the Proprietor arrived in Pennsylvania on the ship Welcome. He visited Philadelphia, just laid out as the capital city, created the three original counties, and summoned a General Assembly to Chester on December 4. This first Assembly united the Delaware counties with Pennsylvania, adopted a naturalization act and, on December 7, adopted the Great Law, a humanitarian code that became the fundamental basis of Pennsylvania law and which guaranteed liberty of conscience. The second Assembly in 1683 reviewed and amended Penn’s First Frame with his cooperation and created the Second Frame of Government. By the time of Penn’s return to England late in 1684, the foundations of the Quaker Province were well established.
Three hundred years later, William Penn and his wife Hannah Callowhill Penn were made honorary citizens of the United States by act of Congress. On May 8, 1985, they were also granted honorary citizenship by Pennsylvania.
Population and Immigration
Native Americans
Although William Penn was granted all the land in Pennsylvania by the King, he and his heirs chose not to grant or settle any part of it without first buying the claims of the Native Americans who lived there. In this manner, all of present Pennsylvania except the northwestern third was purchased by 1768. The Commonwealth bought the Six Nations’ claims to the remainder of the land in 1784 and 1789, and the claims of the Delawares and Wyandots in 1785. The defeat of the French and Indian war alliance by 1760, the withdrawal of the French, the crushing of Chief Pontiac’s Indian alliance in 1764, and the failure of all attempts by Native Americans and colonists to live side by side led the Native Americans to migrate westward, gradually leaving Pennsylvania.
English
Quakers were the dominant English element, although many English settlers were Anglican. The English settled heavily in the southeastern counties, which soon lost frontier characteristics and became the center of a thriving agricultural and commercial society. Philadelphia became the metropolis of the British colonies and a center of intellectual and commercial life.
Germans
Thousands of Germans were also attracted to the colony and, by the time of the Revolution, comprised a third of the population. The volume of German immigration increased after 1727, coming largely from the Rhineland. The Pennsylvania Germans settled most heavily in the interior counties of Northampton, Berks, Lancaster, and Lehigh, and in neighboring areas. Their skill and industry transformed this region into a rich farming country, contributing greatly to the expanding prosperity of the province.
Scotch-Irish
Another important immigrant group was the Scotch-Irish, who migrated from about 1717 until the Revolution in a series of waves caused by hardships in Ireland. They were primarily frontiersmen, pushing first into the Cumberland Valley region and then farther into central and western Pennsylvania. They, with immigrants from old Scotland, numbered about one-fourth of the population by 1776.
African Americans
Despite Quaker opposition to slavery, about 4,000 slaves had been brought to Pennsylvania by 1730, most of them owned by English, Welsh, and Scotch-Irish colonists. The census of 1790 showed that the number of African Americans had increased to about 10,000, of whom about 6,500 had received their freedom. The Pennsylvania Gradual Abolition Act of 1780 was the first emancipation statute in the United States.
Others
Many Quakers were Irish and Welsh, and they settled in the area immediately outside of Philadelphia. French Huguenot and Jewish settlers, together with Dutch, Swedes, and other groups, contributed in smaller numbers to the development of colonial Pennsylvania. The mixture of various national groups in the Quaker Province helped to create its broadminded tolerance and cosmopolitan outlook.
Politics
Pennsylvania’s political history ran a rocky course during the provincial era. There was a natural conflict between the proprietary and popular elements in the government which began under Penn and grew stronger under his successors. As a result of the English Revolution of 1688 which overthrew King James II, Penn was deprived of his province from 1692 until 1694. A popular party led by David Lloyd demanded greater powers for the Assembly, and in 1696 “Markham’s Frame of Government” granted some of these. In December 1699, the Proprietor again visited Pennsylvania and, just before his return to England in 1701, agreed with the Assembly on a revised constitution, the “Charter of Privileges,” which remained in effect until 1776. This guaranteed the Assembly full legislative powers and permitted the three Delaware counties to have a separate legislature. It made Penn’s earlier assurances of religious liberty absolute and irrevocable.
During the colonial period, William Penn and his heirs were both Proprietors and Governors of Pennsylvania within the British Empire. However, except for the 44 months when William himself resided in Pennsylvania, government affairs were administered here by deputy or lieutenant governors (termed “Governor” within Pennsylvania), who were chosen by the Proprietors and obedient to them. The last two resident lieutenant governors, who were in office from 1763 until the Revolution, were grandsons of William Penn. In 1773, the older grandson, John Penn (the 2nd), became both a Proprietor and the resident executive in Pennsylvania, and he was styled “Governor and Commander in Chief.”
William Penn’s heirs, who eventually abandoned Quakerism, were often in conflict with the Assembly, which was usually dominated by the Quakers until 1756. One after another, governors defending the proprietors’ prerogatives battered themselves against the rock of an Assembly vigilant in the defense of its own rights. The people of the frontier areas contended with the people of the older, southeastern region for more adequate representation in the Assembly and better protection in time of war. Such controversies prepared the people for their part in the Revolution.
Colonial Wars
As part of the British Empire, Pennsylvania was involved in the wars between Great Britain and France for dominance in North America. These wars ended the long period when Pennsylvania was virtually without defense. The government built forts and furnished men and supplies to help defend the empire to which it belonged. The territory claimed for New France included western Pennsylvania. The Longueuil and Celoron expeditions of the French in 1739 and 1749 traversed this region, and French traders competed with Pennsylvanians for Indian trade. The French efforts in 1753 and 1754 to establish control over the upper Ohio Valley led to the last and conclusive colonial war, the French and Indian War (1754-1763). French forts at Erie (Fort Presque Isle), Waterford (Fort LeBoeuf), Pittsburgh (Fort Duquesne), and Franklin (Fort Machault) threatened all the middle colonies. In 1753 George Washington of Virginia failed to persuade the French to leave and in 1754 they defeated his militia company at Fort Necessity. In the ensuing war, General Edward Braddock’s British and colonial army was slaughtered on the Monongahela in 1755, but General John Forbes recaptured the site of Pittsburgh in 1758. After the war, the Native Americans rose up against the British colonies in Pontiac’s War, but in August 1763, Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated them at Bushy Run, interrupting the threat to the frontier in this region.
Colonial Pennsylvania’s Tenuous Relation to the Three Counties of Delaware
In 1674, for the second time, England captured from the Dutch the area that became the state of Delaware and the Duke of York made an undocumented assertion that it was part of New York, a colony that he was clearly entitled to govern because of charters from the king. The English land on Delaware Bay was organized as three counties: New Castle, Kent, and Sussex. William Penn’s Charter from King Charles II made no mention of them, although the Duke completed grants that assumed he could legally convey the area to Penn. In 1682 the Pennsylvania Assembly, which had Delaware representatives, approved an Act of Union that made the Pennsylvania Charter applicable to the three counties, but Delaware leaders resented domination by Pennsylvanians. Pennsylvania’s Charter of Privileges of 1701 allowed the union to be dissolved if assemblymen of both colonies agreed to do it. But Delaware leaders refused to acknowledge the Charter of Privileges unless they received as many Assembly seats as the Pennsylvania counties. When the Pennsylvanians would not accept this, Governor Gookin in 1704, convened a separate Assembly for the Delaware counties, which continued to exist until 1776. Delaware and Pennsylvania had separate Assemblies but shared the same governor until 1776, although many Delawareans insisted that the Penn family had no proprietary rights in their counties and that Pennsylvania’s governors had authority in Delaware only because they were royal appointees. At the beginning of the American Revolution, the connection of the governorship function was dissolved when both colonies became states.
Economics
Agriculture
From its beginning, Pennsylvania ranked as a leading agricultural area and produced surpluses for export, adding to its wealth. By the 1750s an exceptionally prosperous farming area had developed in southeastern Pennsylvania. Wheat and corn were the leading crops, though rye, hemp, and flax were also important.
Manufacturing
The abundant natural resources of the colony made for early development of industries. Arts and crafts, as well as home manufactures, grew rapidly. Sawmills and gristmills were usually the first to appear, using the power of the numerous streams. Textile products were spun and woven mainly in the home, though factory production was not unknown. Shipbuilding became important on the Delaware. The province gained importance in iron manufacturing, producing pig iron as well as finished products. Printing, publishing, and the related industry of papermaking, as well as tanning, were significant industries. The Pennsylvania long rifle was an adaptation of a German hunting rifle developed in Lancaster County. Its superiority was so well recognized that by 1776 gunsmiths were duplicating it in Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, and Maryland. The Conestoga wagon was also developed in Lancaster County. Capable of carrying as much as four tons, it was the prototype for the principal vehicle for American westward migration, the prairie schooner.
Commerce and Transportation
The rivers were important as early arteries of commerce and were soon supplemented by roads in the southeastern section. By 1776, stagecoach lines reached from Philadelphia into the southcentral region. Trade with the Indians for furs was important in the colonial period. Later, the transport and sale of farm products to Philadelphia and Baltimore, by water and road, formed an important business. Philadelphia became one of the most important centers in the colonies for the conduct of foreign trade and the commercial metropolis of an expanding hinterland.
Society and Culture
Arts and Learning
Philadelphia was known in colonial times as the “Athens of America” because of its rich cultural life. Because of the liberality of Penn’s principles and the freedom of expression that prevailed, the province developed a conspicuous variety and strength in its intellectual and educational institutions and interests. An academy that held its first classes in 1740 became the College of Philadelphia in 1755, and ultimately grew into the University of Pennsylvania. It was the only nondenominational college of the colonial period. The arts and sciences flourished, and the public buildings of Philadelphia were the marvel of the colonies. Many fine old buildings in the Philadelphia area still bear witness to the richness of Pennsylvania’s civilization in the eighteenth century. Such men of intellect as Benjamin Franklin, David Rittenhouse, John Bartram, and Benjamin West achieved international renown. Newspapers and magazines flourished, as did law and medicine. Pennsylvania can claim America’s first hospital, first library, and first insurance company.
Religion
Quakers held their first religious meeting at Upland (now Chester) in 1675, and they came to Pennsylvania in great numbers after William Penn received his Charter. Most numerous in the southeastern counties, the Quakers gradually declined in number but retained considerable influence. The Pennsylvania Germans belonged largely to the Lutheran and Reformed churches, but there were also several smaller sects: Mennonites, Amish, German Baptist Brethren or “Dunkers,” Schwenkfelders, and Moravians. Although the Lutheran Church was established by the Swedes on Tinicum Island in 1643, it only began its growth to become the largest of the Protestant denominations in Pennsylvania upon the arrival of Henry Melchior Muhlenberg in 1742. The Reformed Church owed its expansion to Michael Schlatter, who arrived in 1746. The Moravians did notable missionary work among the Native Americans. The Church of England held services in Philadelphia as early as 1695. The first Catholic congregation was organized in Philadelphia in 1720, and the first chapel was erected in 1733; Pennsylvania had the second largest Catholic population among the colonies. The Scotch brought Presbyterianism; its first congregation was organized in Philadelphia in 1698. Scotch-Irish immigrants swelled its numbers. Methodism began late in the colonial period. St. George’s Church, built in Philadelphia in 1769, is the oldest Methodist building in America. There was also a significant Jewish population in colonial Pennsylvania. Its Mikveh Israel Congregation was established in Philadelphia in 1740.
Pennsylvania’s Borders
The southern boundary, especially the famous Mason-Dixon Line dividing Pennsylvania and Maryland, which was surveyed and marked by the English team of Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon in 1767 and approved in Britain two years later, ended arguments begun when Charles II had issued Pennsylvania’s Charter in 1681. Maryland’s Charter of 1632 extended to the Delaware River above Philadelphia, and the boundary description in the Pennsylvania Charter was obscured by ambiguous terms and its creators’ limited knowledge of geography. In 1685 King James II determined that Maryland would not have the three counties of Delaware, but it was not until 1732 that Maryland’s proprietor agreed that the longitudinal line separating his colony from Pennsylvania would run from a point fifteen miles south of the most southern point in Philadelphia. Within a year he changed his mind, so that lengthy High Court of Chancery proceedings in England and armed clashes between Maryland and Pennsylvania settlers had to occur before a chancery decree in 1760 authorized the final settlement, a refinement of the 1732 bargain. Mason and Dixon were called in when American surveyors were unable to calculate boundary lines that matched the authorized specifications.
The 1681 Charter’s provisions for Pennsylvania’s western expanse clashed with the land description in Virginia’s older charter. From 1773 until the opening of the American Revolution, Virginia’s governor, Lord Dunmore, controlled southwestern Pennsylvania as a district of Virginia, and irregular warfare took place between his followers and settlers loyal to Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania’s northern boundary was also undetermined, and settlers from Connecticut, organized as the private Susquehannah Company, arguing on the basis of both Connecticut’s colonial charter and a questionable land purchase deed made from some Iroquois chiefs in 1754, occupied the Wyoming Valley and had hopes of obtaining much of northern Pennsylvania. Both Pennsylvania and Susquehannah settlers were forced out of the Wyoming area during the French and Indian War and the Native American Insurgency of 1763. At the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (or “Old Purchase”) in 1768, Pennsylvania purchased from the Iroquois a vast expanse of the land included within the 1681 Charter. Arguing that this confirmed their 1754 deed, the Connecticut settlers re-entered northeastern Pennsylvania. In 1774, Connecticut’s government decided to officially support the Susquehannah Company settlers, and by the beginning of the American Revolution they had defeated the neighboring Pennsylvania settlers in several campaigns known as the Yankee-Pennamite Wars.
Also dating back to an ambiguity in the Charter of 1681, and overlapping with the dispute with Connecticut, was the question of the longitudinal line separating New York and Pennsylvania. On the assumption that Charles II had really meant to give William Penn three full degrees of north-south latitude (about 180 miles), Pennsylvania argued for the 43° parallel, placing the border above the site of Buffalo, N.Y. At about the same time the Mason-Dixon Line became official, Pennsylvania’s proprietors yielded to New York and accepted the 42° parallel as the northern border. The intervening controversy with Connecticut and the Revolutionary War delayed surveying and marking the line until 1787.
The Era of Benjamin Franklin, 1727-1790
The career of the versatile genius and popular leader Benjamin Franklin spans Pennsylvania’s history from his first appearance in Philadelphia until his death in 1790. He led the way to the establishment of beneficial civic institutions including newspapers and other popular publications, a fire company, a circulating library, a hospital, paper money, and a postal mail system. The persuasiveness of his popular writings imbued the public with common sense, public morality, and optimism. His scientific research explored natural phenomenon, and his inventions enlarged human mastery of the environment. His political leadership was critical to the movement for independent establishment of governments intended to operate for the best interests of humanity. As an outstanding example of an individual rising through his own abilities, Franklin has always been upheld as a model for Americans.
Pennsylvania on the Eve of the Revolution
By 1776, the Province of Pennsylvania had become the third largest English colony in America, though next to the last to be founded. Philadelphia had become the largest English-speaking city in the world next to London. There were originally only three counties: Philadelphia, Chester, and Bucks, but by 1773 there were eleven. Westmoreland, the last new county created before the Revolution, was the first county located entirely west of the Allegheny Mountains.
The American Revolution had urban origins, and Philadelphia was a center of ferment. Groups of Philadelphia artisans and mechanics, many loyal to Benjamin Franklin, formed a grassroots revolutionary leadership. Philadelphia had been a center of resistance to the Stamp Act in 1765, and it moved quickly to support Boston in opposition to Britain’s Intolerable Acts in 1774.

Setting
Timeline
1815-1911: Post-Toltec Europe
Once the English defeat the French in 1815 with advanced Toltec weapons, the Congress of Vienna is established. This redrew borders as per the standard timeline. Other great powers were concerned over England’s technology. Technology espionage starts on the battlefield with some weapons stolen.
1763-1783: Point of Divergence
From the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until the end of the Seven Year’s War of 1763, a philosophical and political rift occurred both in America and Britain. Americans viewed Locke’s Second Treatise of Government as a blueprint for social change. The British viewed it as wasted paper. Benign neglect from the 1720s to 1740s resulted in colonists assuming more control for their affairs; home rule _de jure_. This neglect was shattered during the Seven Year’s War, but Americans exploited the crisis with their more sophisticated understanding of politics and emerged from the War debt-free and ready to assert its independence. In England, Parliament weakened the Crown’s control over politics and the prerogative system, nearly reducing the Crown to a figurehead. George III subverted that trend by taking control of Parliament in the years between his coronation in 1760 and the end of the War in 1763.
Saddled with war debt and the need to protect North America, George’s Parliament enacted the Sugar Act, which reduced the tax on molasses. Americans rioted and decried this as an intrusion into its home rule. The period known as the American Troubles (1763-67) were pivotal in stabilizing British-American relations and establishing the modern British Commonwealth.
During the Troubles, Crown and Parliament exploited American internecine jealousies and prejudices to prevent this strain from flaring into mutiny. George recognized the threat to stability and had Parliament invite American colonies to send delegates to negotiate. An agreement similar to the earlier home rule “Albany Plan” pitched by Benjamin Franklin in 1755 was agreed upon. The Stamp Act of 1765 &amp; Declaratory Act of 1766 never occur. Timelines diverge.[^OTL-American-Troubles]
[^OTL-American-Troubles]: OTL: The watershed period from 1763-1767 divided America and Britain. The Proclamation in 1763, the Sugar Act in 1764, Stamp Act of 1765 and its repeal / Declaratory Act of 1766 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 progressively strained and broke relations. As cold hostilities turned to hot war, moderates sought to halt the separation until by the 1777 Battle of Saratoga it became clear no reunification was possible.

Toltec weaponry thwarted Pontiac’s Rebellion in Summer of 1763, which prevented the Declaratory Act from being enacted. Instead, King George sends a full regiment to ensure the Ohio is retained and negotiations for American home rule started. REMOVE
In 1765, Parliament invited a delegation from each of the mainland colonies to work out differences that included Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. This extended negotiation (1765-68) blunted Radical demands for independence. However, a splinter from the Sons of Liberty continued the (now unpopular) fight for American Independence. This splinter movement is a key area of conflict in Discovery Season.
These negotiations led to legislation that addressed British North America grievances and allowed both sides of the Atlantic to move forward in a tense harmony.

#### Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769
The Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769 extended all customary rights &amp; privileges to native-English speaking white settlers in British North America. This created some frustration with Caribbean Colonials. Many Caribbean colonists remedied this by establishing residence in Charles Town, Carolina. However, this addressed the IRL complaints of colonialists that they were not treated to the rights they would have enjoyed had they remained home.
This disenfranchised French-Canadian residents as their native language was French. Many raised their children speaking English to extend these rights to them.
#### British North America Act of 1771
British North America sought representation in Parliament. The government agreed, providing the colonies restructured. This act transformed the continental colonies to six self-regulated provinces:
Canada,
New England (some called Camelot),
Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York),
Virginia (includes Maryland &amp; Delaware),
Carolina,
&amp; Georgia.
This act further gave those provincial governments representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Charlotina province is added in 1803, encompassing IRL Northwest Territory United States. Parliament calculated this reorganization of the colonies into provinces would create internal tension that would allow England to retain control.
This created frustration among the joined colonies (NY, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island &amp; Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New Hampshire), especially RI&amp;PP as they sought to be more tolerant religiously than Massachusetts. This is an example of Parliament’s intentional friction within the provinces.

#### Rights of Religious Liberty Act of 1772
British North America sought religious liberty. Parliament sought its debts to be paid and taxation for its recurring budget. Some of this budget paid Anglican ministerial salaries. This act permitted provinces to manage their own religious affairs. This effectively abolishes the Anglican church in British North America except for Virginia and Carolina. Thus liberty was a province matter, instead of individual. The lack of Anglican minsters removes British North America’s obligation to pay that portion of the budget. British North America provinces are allowed to establish their own state religions.
Virginia and Carolina remained Anglican.
Canada was not allowed to have Catholics in government, but was otherwise Catholic territory.
New England became officially Congregationalist (Puritan). Though the power of puritanism lapsed a generation before, there is still enough friction between the denominations.
Pennsylvania extended its religious tolerance through New York, making it a bastion for downtrodden faiths.
#### War Debt Equity Act of 1772
In the _quid pro quo_ for the Rights of Religious Liberty Act, British North America provinces agreed to take on half of the Government’s debt incurred by the end of the French &amp; Indian War. Whether this meant war debt or total debt was a matter of disagreement that was settled during the Napoleonic Era. The Seven Years’ War nearly doubled Great Britain’s national debt, so the question of whether British North America provinces accepted a quarter or half of the debt was no small issue. Buried in this act was the liquidation of various debts by prominent members of British North America society. This pushed the Sons of Liberty into the fringe by bribing the elite.

1764-1840: The Indian Problem
At the end of the Seven Year’s War, an estimated 4.5 million Indians lived in North America.[@calloway2007scratch] Britain was sensitive to protect its new territorial gains by not antagonizing them. In Summer 1763, Parliament debated constraining its settlers on the Atlantic side of the Appalachian continental divide as a suite of measures to establish greater control over the colonies and improve Indian relations. Discovery of advanced weaponry and their role in thwarting Pontiac’s Rebellion tabled the Proclamation of 1763.
The home rule negotiation led to establishing new colonies in Indian territory. Those colonies were expected to become provinces when full British sovereignty was exerted and Englishmen were comfortable “in their hearths and homes.” Americans agreed to fund British Army operations to secure settlers in those areas and accelerate this effort. They also formed local militia that operated under Army authority. Mississippi colony welcomed a higher number of British military veterans, leading to a strong military tradition in that region.
This is too American. The British would have handled it like they did India. See [@keay1995honourable]
This agreement did not sit well with the Indians, who continued to harass settlers. The 1768 Stanwix and Hard Labour treaties ceded control from some indians, but not all. War flared up in 1774 and continued through 1782.[^indian-war-1770s] The role of the French led to renewed hostilities between France and England before France was ready. This led to a hot war between the two sides from 1778 to 1783.
[^indian-war-1770s]: OTL: This is consistent with history apart from the impact on the American Revolution. British supported the indians until news in 1782 of the peace treaty. [@WesternTheaterAmerican2020]
The Ohio War of the 1780s flared up over increased white settlement, aided by French agents and a splinter group from the Sons of Liberty who thought that Ohio should become an independent nation. The Battle of Fallen Timbers of 1784 broke the back of Indian resistance. This paved the way for English settlement of southern and western Ohio.

1783-1848: Eradication of African Slavery
&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
&gt; Discuss actual trends in African Slavery in Britain in this era.
Without the American Revolution, the anti-slavery movement in England starts earlier. Over this 50-year period (1772-1848), slavery was eliminated throughout the British Empire.
•	1772 - Somerset’s Case holds there is no basis for slavery in English law, and held that laws supporting slavery were against Natural Law. This extends to BNA.
•	1787 - Wilberforce’s Anti-Slavery Society struggled against London Society of West India Planters and Merchants who fought against abolition of slavery.
•	1807 - During a break in the French Troubles, England de-legalizes trans-shipment of slaves on the Oceans and between non-connected provinces.
•	1833 - “Apprenticeship Act of 1833” ends slavery in all British holdings by stages &amp; “apprenticeships.” Chattel is immediately repudiated by Parliament, meaning that African children were born free. Slave owners were mollified by a tax break for each freeborn child. Slave owners were compensated by tax. American high-society slave owners were well-compensated, lower-class owners were not, leading to some animosity. Increased investment in Toltec technology helps blunt the need for slaves during the Apprenticeship Period (1833-1846).
•	1846-48 - Apprenticeships ended in American provinces (Virginia, Carolina, Georgia) to increase representation in Parliament, leading to local civil conflicts in each province by the lower class “masters,” which was put down by General Scott.

1783-1815: French Troubles
IRL: At the end of the Seven Years’ War, England’s strategy in the Treaty of Paris (1763) sought to deter France from start a fifth war. France, however, sought to use the treaty to give them time to rebuild and rearm. French diplomats believed that without France to keep the Americans in check, the colonists might attempt to revolt. The American Revolution was that much-desired revolt.[^paris-treaty-1763]
[^paris-treaty-1763]: Wikipedia. _Treaty of Paris (1763)_. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)
The negotiations between British North America and England and discovery of Toltec Technology blunted the American desire to revolt.
•	1783-1815 - French economy collapses due to Seven Year’s War debt and speculation and takes the government with it. The French Revolution is a decade early, ends the same but with American participation in Europe.
•	1802-1815 - War between France and most of Europe. Ended by British &amp; American deployment of Toltec weaponry
The French economy struggles under reparations required in the Treaty of Paris (1763). The government gets caught up in various schemes to pay the debt that results in a popular uprising in 1783.
Napoleon is involved as a republican during the early stages of the struggle, and gains power as expected. England takes control of New Orleans when Napoleon moves on Spain, and keeps it. Napoleon sends troops in 1801, triggering the war between England and France &amp; Spain (the latter as a vassal to France).
This “Napoleonic War” is ended by British &amp; American deployment of Toltec weaponry in 1815. Napoleon is executed and a new French king is placed on the throne. This ends the French Troubles.
The Louisiana Territory is kept by England as compensation for the war, and to further safeguard English interest and control over Toltec artifacts.

#### Faster-than-Light Travel Physics via Wormholes
Faster-than-light travel is possible via wormholes, known as Slipstreams. IRL, wormholes are a scientific conjecture, derived from the same equations that describe black holes. We cannot conceive of how to get to or use a wormhole. In Strand, however, wormholes are a convenient means of travel from one place to another. People traverse wormholes using a Jump drive, with each wormhole connecting between only two locations. Travel time is near instantaneous for the jumping ship and its occupants.
A Slipknot is the term used by Toltecs and adopted by English (Laufknoten in German, Trou de Biche (tru-de-beesh) in French, Hueco in Spanish, Orifício in Portuguese).
Neutrino Energy
Neutrino energy is a theoretical way of converting the kinetic energy of cosmic into into direct current (DC) electricity.
The energy is converted by layers a conductive film, silicone film and graphene film. The conductive film comprises silver, gold, copper, gallium or aluminum or one of their alloys, in particular of a silver or gold alloy or an aluminum-gallium alloy. Each film layer is very fine, measured in 100s of nanometers. See Neutrino Power Cube[sec:neutrino-power-cube] for the scientific application.
IRL Research:
•	The neutrino is the source of abundant, clean, renewable energy.[^nutrino-energy]
•	Neutrinovoltaic - a low voltage system of 12/24/48V DC
•	Neutrino Film is “a film made of metal or a metal alloy, in particular a film made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a so-called neutrino or ntrino film (registered trademarks), to a method of production and to a use of a film made of metal or a metal alloy.” [^WO2016142056A1]
•	Neutrino Power Cubes are highly sophisticated power cells that have the advantage of being able to supply energy in complete darkness. They do this by harnessing the kinetic energy created by invisible waves of cosmic radiation, transforming it into micro-vibrations in a complex resonation process facilitated by super-symmetrical coatings on a stable substrate. And because these power cells can be stacked on top of one another, they are more compact and efficient than today’s solar cells and far less easily damaged.[^Neutrino-energy]
•	Neutrino Energy Harvesting is when energy can be derived from many different sources such as radio waves, vibrations, heat, or light, and these sources can be either natural or artificial. Solar cells convert light; thermoelectric generators convert heat flux (temperature differences); and Neutrino Power Cubes convert vibrations caused by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos into electricity.[^Neutrino-Wiki]

Slower-than-Light Travel
Slower-than-light travel follows the IRL laws of physics. Access to Toltec technology accelerates research, leading to efficient “Edison” drives.
#### Travel Times
The table below describes the constraints of space travel. Most space ships are fuel constrained based on their acceleration ability, shown by the Duration. Travel between Earth and the slipsteam is within the limits of those ships. Those with extended durations can travel four times further than regular ships, at the expense of crew comfort. Those ships could safely make it to Uranus and back, but not to the Oort cloud.
•	Civilian ships have a maximum acceleration of V-shift 3.
•	Military ships have a maximum acceleration of 2G (V-shift 5.
•	Slipknot (5AU), Moon, Mars (1.5AU), Uranus (19AU), Oort (0.3ly) columns all refer to travel time from Earth to those (average distance) locations. Distances between planets,[^sol-distance] Oort[^oort-distance] and Belt (1AU) [^belt-distance] are estimated for the sake of simplicity.
The table below describes the travel time between Earth and the target, as provided by the Space travel calculator.[^stl-calc]

The main (or core) population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, which are based on what is known as “Kirkwood gaps”. Named after Daniel Kirkwood, who announced in 1866 the discovery of gaps in the distance of asteroids, these gaps are similar to what is seen with Saturn’s and other gas giants’ systems of rings. https://www.notion.so/1f5ce610ebbb44d68c53e3d4c847c22d

            <Text>Value Proposition / Business Model
What’s compelling about the proposition? Why do customers buy, use?
Strand provides uplifting serial fiction novellas to satisfy our customer segments’ desire for entertainment. Each novella should be short enough to fit in the time a reader / listener is either at the airport, in the air, or in the car. Novellas seasons are long enough to fill a long-hauler’s driving week. Being short, we are not competing heavily for their time with other entertainment options. We fill the gap.
Our Author business model is “solo-developed high-volume fiction.” We seek to put out a new 10-book season every two years to start, launching a new book very 2 months. In a perfect world (full-time writing), a new season would launch every year with books released monthly. In both cases, there is time for two months off.
We are not distracting ourselves with other value propositions, such as speaking, consulting, or other business options like helping other writers.</Text>

            <Text>Advanced Ancient Humans
This trope is when modern-day/near-future humans discover that they actually had a super advanced society eons ago, in pre-history. In other words, Homo sapiens are their own Precursors. This prehistoric civilization, for whatever reason, fell or disappeared before our recorded history began, thus explaining why nobody knew about it before. Oftentimes they lived in an Advanced Ancient Acropolis which they’ll leave behind for present explorers to marvel at.
Compare Human Aliens, Adam and Eve Plot, Earth All Along. For a specific subtrope of this, see Atlantis (depending on how advanced it’s depicted as being). For any species that came before us, including aliens, see Precursors. Compare Ultra Terrestrials, when an alien species turns out to also be from Earth but developed and left way in pre-history (before humans were around). Often overlaps with Humanity Came From Space. When the story is set in a future where humanity is extinct, see Humanity’s Wake. See Humanity Is Advanced where humanity is the current Advanced Alien. If we have evolved to the point these guys are not immediately recognizable as human they may also be Original Man.</Text>

Summary
Albert Strand, protagonist
is the descendent of one of the Slipstream discoverers. His drive to honor the family legacy leads him to turn his back on his new family and spend two years on a research orbital. As his tour wraps up, his orbital is attacked by anarchists, forcing him to abandon ship. The ship inexplicably navigates straight to the surface below. He crashes. He awakes hostage on an alien world. He uses his knowledge of advanced technology to survive. He tries desperately to develop the means to return home while trying to maneuver in the real war on the alien planet. But, he must keep the alien humans from mastering the technology and awaking the real threat to his homeworld.
Adomas Galliulin - Alien ruler - Country, Antagonist
wants to dominate his wee continent. He paints himself as the victim and tries to seduce Albert (whom he calls “Herbert”, which is a play on words) to support him with newfangled weapons. He wants a doomsday weapon. He is “Country.”
Tongo Rad - Alien scientist - Duty
works for AR. He’s assigned to help with the doomsday weapon and steal ideas from Albert. His fanatical dedication to AR is slowly eroded by his interaction with Albert. He decides (or pretends to) help Albert get home. He is “Duty.”
Irina Galliulin - Alien princess - Honor
is AR’s daughter. She falls in love with Albert and wants him to fall in love with her. She is “Honor.”
Dr. Strand - Albert’s Father - Country
wants to keep his domination of industry. When his son is reported missing, he is split between serving his company and saving his son who is probably dead. “I have another.”
Michael Richards - Albert’s “best” Friend - Duty
was with him when they were attacked, and helped Albert escape. We learn early on this was a ruse to get rid of Albert so that his friend could go after the widow…
Charles Napier - Albert’s true best Friend - Duty
with him before being sent home. He is the action between the Father &amp; Wife…while the Father comes to want his son home, he can’t do the work.
Mabel Downey - Albert’s wife &amp; Family - Honor
she is heartbroken when he left, and mourns when she finds him reported missing. She is suspicious of the friend, especially after he clearly makes advances to him. She is the steel that pushes Father to do something, and develops to be a force to be reckoned with.
Clarance Dankworth
Hot-headed Ulster orphan who managed to get into a public school with Albert and became “Blaster” to Albert’s “Master.” He replaces Charles as the unofficial Strand guardian. He is strand along with Albert.
Slora Hanlon
Thrown into prison the episode after Albert and after Mabel prays for Albert. He’s the mentor.

Mckees Rocks Mound

  Hits: 14712

American Indians are the indigenous peoples of North America and for thousands of years they inhabited the Ohio Valley. The first identified people known to inhabit the Ohio River Valley were the tribes of Adena in 800 B.C. and Hopewell in 400 B.C.
Native Americans built ancient earthen mounds over a sacred burial place as a memorial or landmark, or as a site for ceremonial, ritual, spiritual, or religious rites. Indian peoples built mounds made of earth in various shapes and sizes across eastern North America. Mound building developed among Indians in the Ohio Valley during the Adena culture stage (800 B.C.-100 A.D.) and then flourished during the Hopewell (100-500 A.D.) and Mississippian Eras (700-1300 A.D.). The McKees Rocks Mound is located at the confluence of Chartiers Creek and the Ohio River four miles south of downtown Pittsburgh. 
The mounds were topics of much conjecture during the westward expansion of the United States, even though Thomas Jefferson had excavated a mound and deduced it to be the creation of American Indians. Regrettably, as the last of the eastern Indian tribes were driven west of the Mississippi along the Trail of Tears, Jefferson's conclusions were forgotten, and the mounds were mistakenly thought to have been the work of a lost race of Mound Builders. This myth was finally laid to rest by the Smithsonian Institution's archaeologists in the late 20th-century when prehistoric indigenous Indian people were again recognized to have built all of the mounds in the United States.
The McKees Rock Mound is dome-shaped earthwork is estimated at 85 feet in diameter and 266 feet in circumference and at least 16 feet in height.  It is the oldest Indian burial ground in western Pennsylvania and one of the oldest mounds in America. Furthermore, it is undoubtedly the most impressive example of ancient Indian architecture in modern Pennsylvania. Initial excavation of McKees Rocks Mound occurred in 1896 by Frank M. Gerrodette of the Carnegie Museum. The excavation found 33 skeletons and yielded religious artifacts and shells from both the Adena and the Hopewell people, some of which were made of copper or marine shells. This find led archaeologists to believe that the Adena participated in widespread trade.
The archaeological evidence suggests that this mound was built in three stages by Indians of the late Adena and early Hopewell cultures. Most of the recovered artifacts are associated with the Adena and Hopewell cultures, but archaeologists have also found materials associated with the much later Monongahela culture, which established a village on the promontory during the late Woodland Period (1000-1500 A.D.).
Today, archaeologists do not excavate Indian burials unless such sites are disturbed by some other event, such as a construction project, that will result in their destruction. That professional commitment, along with the protection of many surviving mounds in local, state, and national parks, is helping to preserve this important element of the American past for future generations.
In 1946, James Fulton, a Republican congressional representative from Pennsylvania unsuccessfully introduced legislation to turn the 19-acre tract on McKees Rocks Hill into a national park. Unfortunately, no protection resulted, and by the 1950s, a large chunk of the Indian burial mound had fallen into the Ohio River. Only a vestige of the original site survives today and is overgrown with weeds, trees and shrubs but nothing is built on the surviving mound now. The mound lies behind Wilson School on private property owned by Gordon Terminal Service Co., McKees Rocks Borough, and Lane Construction Corporation concrete plant.
Nevertheless, the remnant survives as testimony to the engineering skills and public architecture of Adena-Hopewell peoples. The mound stands as a reminder that there have been other great and proud civilizations upon this land, which have left their mark, and vanished. A state historical marker dedicated on May 18, 2002 resides near Rangers Field, Shingiss and Sproul Streets at the Bottoms section of McKees Rocks.The Mound Society of Western Pennsylvania believes that the site should undergo a Cultural Resource Management investigation to determine precisely the mound's size, age and origin. The society is interested returning the Adena and Hopewell remains to the mound ultimately preserving the area as a national park or world heritage site as a tribute to the Native American’s that lie under our feet and overlooking Pittsburgh from its ancient bluff.

            <Title>1764-1840: The Indian Problem</Title>
            <Text>1764-1840: The Indian Problem
At the end of the Seven Year’s War, an estimated 4.5 million Indians lived in North America.[@calloway2007scratch] Britain was sensitive to protect its new territorial gains by not antagonizing them. In Summer 1763, Parliament debated constraining its settlers on the Atlantic side of the Appalachian continental divide as a suite of measures to establish greater control over the colonies and improve Indian relations. Discovery of advanced weaponry and their role in thwarting Pontiac’s Rebellion tabled the Proclamation of 1763.
The home rule negotiation led to establishing new colonies in Indian territory. Those colonies were expected to become provinces when full British sovereignty was exerted and Englishmen were comfortable “in their hearths and homes.” Americans agreed to fund British Army operations to secure settlers in those areas and accelerate this effort. They also formed local militia that operated under Army authority. Mississippi colony welcomed a higher number of British military veterans, leading to a strong military tradition in that region.
This is too American. The British would have handled it like they did India. See [@keay1995honourable]
This agreement did not sit well with the Indians, who continued to harass settlers. The 1768 Stanwix and Hard Labour treaties ceded control from some indians, but not all. War flared up in 1774 and continued through 1782. OTL: This is consistent with history apart from the impact on the American Revolution. British supported the indians until news in 1782 of the peace treaty. [@WesternTheaterAmerican2020] The role of the French led to renewed hostilities between France and England before France was ready. This led to a hot war between the two sides from 1778 to 1783.
The Ohio War of the 1780s flared up over increased white settlement, aided by French agents and a splinter group from the Sons of Liberty who thought that Ohio should become an independent nation. The Battle of Fallen Timbers of 1784 broke the back of Indian resistance. This paved the way for English settlement of southern and western Ohio.

The colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Hampshire were consolidated into the Province of New England. This included all land South of the St. Lawrence, which extends to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and parts of Quebec. All land east of the Hudson becomes New England as well, except for Manhattan and Long Island. This led to considerable resistance by the Sons of Liberty, and led a small rebellion put down by Virginia and Pennsylvania.

            <Text>#### Charlotina (Ohio)

Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Charlotina was established as a Crown colony encompassing the OTL US Northwest Territory boundaries. The argument and name emerged in a 1764 Scottish pamphlet entitled _The Expediency of Securing our American Colonies by Settling the Country Adjoining the River Mississippi, and the Country upon the Ohio, Considered_.[^wiki-charlotina] Calving Charlotina from existing colonies provided the Crown with a way of managing Indian relations and generating revenue. While land in Charlotina was given to Seven Year's War veterans as OTL, the Crown sought a more active role in assigning the land. Washington managed to make himself the Royal Surveyor, which allowed him to exploit land grants as he sought to do OTL. Washington instituted the Township survey method instead of the traditional metes &amp; bounds method. The Temple is in Charlotina, making its history relevant.

[^wiki-charlotina]: Wikipedia. _Charlotina_. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotina.

**Boundaries.**
Charlotina included the region lying west of the Maumee and Wabash rivers; north of the Ohio River; east of the upper Mississippi River; and south of the Great Lakes. These boundaries would include portions of modern-day Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and the entirety of Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Charlotina will later include the modern-day cities of Chicago, Milwaukee, Toledo, Detroit, Fort Wayne, and parts of Minneapolis and St. Paul.
The Charlotina-Pennsylvanian border starts from the Easternmost end of Lake Erie, heading down a True South line until that line intersects the Allegheny River (near OTL intersection of I-86 and Rt-280/Quaker Run Road). It then follows the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh.
The Charlotina-Mississippian border starts at the intersection of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at Pittsburgh and continues along the Ohio where Charlotina is on the northern bank and Mississippi is on the southern bank.
The Charlotina-Canadian border follows the middle point of the Great Lakes...

Shippensburg is a borough in Cumberland and Franklin counties in the U.S. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Settled in 1730, Shippensburg lies in the Cumberland Valley, 41 miles (66 km) southwest of Harrisburg, and is part of the Harrisburg–Carlisle Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,492 at the 2010 census.[5] Of this, 4,416 were in Cumberland County, and 1,076 were in Franklin County.

Shippensburg was incorporated as a borough on January 21, 1819. In the past, there were furniture factories, engine and pump works, and other industrial works located within the town. Shippensburg is the home of the Beistle Company, the oldest manufacturer of decorations and party goods in the U.S. In May 2012, Volvo Construction Equipment began a $100 million expansion project to bring its American headquarters to Shippensburg.[6]

Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania, one of 14 universities of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, is located just north of the borough limits in Shippensburg Township.

History[edit]
Shippensburg is the oldest community of the Cumberland Valley, and the second oldest west of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania (after York to the east). In July 1730, 12 Scots-Irish families came to the site of the present-day Shippensburg and built cabin homes along Burd's Run. Shippensburg began as the western outpost of colonial settlement.

The village received its name from Edward Shippen, a prominent resident of Lancaster (and onetime mayor of Philadelphia) who obtained the patent to the land from the heirs of William Penn. Edward Shippen's granddaughter, Peggy Shippen, was historically notable as the wife of General Benedict Arnold, who betrayed the Continental Army by defecting to the British during the American Revolutionary War.

In 1735, Samuel Perry built the Widow Piper's Tavern, which stands at the southwest corner of East King Street and Queen Street. This building was selected as the place for the first Cumberland County Courts in 1750 and 1751. The building has been restored and serves today as the home of the Shippensburg Civic Club.

On July 9, 1755, Edward Morris, the governor of Shippensburg, ordered that a fort be built after he learned of General Braddock's defeat at the hands of the French and Indians. His intent was to provide protection for the troops and colonists during the French and Indian War. Over the next year, several buildings, a 70-foot-deep (21 m) well, and a log palisade were built. Fort Morris was garrisoned until the early 1760s but preserved for several more years due to the efforts of Edward Shippen. There is also a record that an officer and eighteen provincial troops were stationed in Shippensburg during the winter of 1763-1764. On March 24, 1761, Shippen wrote, "I desire everybody in Shippensburg to take care of ye Fort for I will suffer a log of it to be thrown down on any pretense whatever."

Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania was founded in 1871 as a normal school.

In 2009, a team of archaeologists reported they had discovered the site of Fort Morris on Burd Street. Among the artifacts found were pottery, coins, buttons, musket balls, flints and musket parts. Some of these artifacts are housed in Shearer Hall on the Shippensburg University campus, while others are currently on display at the Shippensburg Historical Society.

The Shippensburg Historic District, Dykeman's Spring, the Benjamin Blythe Homestead, Cumberland Valley State Normal School Historic District, the Shippen House, and Widow Piper's Tavern are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[7]

General information[edit]
Local telephone exchanges in Shippensburg are 300, 360, 477, 530, and 532.

The PIAA high school track and field and softball championships are held at Shippensburg University.

Geography[edit]
Shippensburg is located in south-central Pennsylvania at 40°2′58″N 77°31′26″W (40.049453, -77.523830),[8] primarily in Cumberland County, but extending west into Franklin County.

U.S. Route 11 passes through the center of town as King Street; US 11 leads northeast 20 miles (32 km) to Carlisle, the Cumberland County seat, and southwest 11 miles (18 km) to Chambersburg, the Franklin County seat. Pennsylvania Route 696 leads north out of Shippensburg as Earl Street and south as Fayette Street. Via PA 696 it is 6 miles (10 km) north to Newburg and 3 miles (5 km) south to Exit 24 on Interstate 81. Pennsylvania Route 533 leads west out of town as Morris Street, 5 miles (8 km) to Orrstown. Pennsylvania Route 174 (Walnut Bottom Road) split east from US 11 at the east edge of the borough, leading 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to Exit 29 on Interstate 81 and 6 miles (10 km) to the village of Walnut Bottom in South Newton Township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough of Shippensburg has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.2 km2), of which 0.004 square miles (0.01 km2), or 0.18%, is water.[5] Gum Run flows through the center of town, entering from the south and becoming Middle Spring Creek, a north-flowing tributary of Conodoguinet Creek and part of the Susquehanna River watershed. Outside the town, the area consists of mostly field and pasture, some forest, few streams and water holes.

### Being Good Sucks

If being good were as easy as most cartoons make it out to be, everyone would be a saint. [Truth is][1SsCHjx9], sometimes Being Good Sucks. Doing the right thing doesn't always [feel good][IUc9rR1y], is hard to pull off, can be painful, sometimes even harmful, to yourself and others. Being good requires a [Heroic Sacrifice][2KZ7vTLA], [keeping your word][5KQmQ02G], and thinking of others before yourself. It means swallowing your [pride][02D0Ewh3], [owning up to][xpCP34xn] and apologizing for your mistakes. It means doing the above without expecting a reward (even a spoken [thank you][7og7AiOH]), [refusing one if offered][VomOnC6U]—and most ego-crushing—[accepting the punishment for being good][BW1IsYBy].

The variations are endless, but below is a condensed catalog:

- Sacrificing your own happiness: It can be any type of happiness, be it [denying romance to protect][wYaAKJi7] the [Love Interest][5vg6yO0U], or where their quest [To Be a Master][B7ZllhDj] is leveraged against a friend's life when the [Friend or Idol Decision][M0x87kdY] comes along.
- Giving up your ambitions: Usually these are selfish or dark ambitions, and denying them *helps* the character in the long run. When a character wants [Revenge][dvmtUVf5] for the murder of a [loved one][MpqEZL8g] in a world where [If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him][Xg0V0DLV], their giving up murder (though not necessarily forgiving the villain) will cost them dearly but ultimately be the right thing. However, this can extend to less dark goals, when [Ambition Is Evil][s6JXoiA3]. If the story deems the character's dream as "selfish" or bad, they have no choice but to give up.
- Good behaviour. Obvious as it is, being good requires *acting* good. This means sharing, [forgiving others][qEuVY0c9], not killing people and generally acting contrary to one's impulses to be a [Jerkass][7wa7MkDQ] to those disliked. No matter how much they may wish or be tempted to do otherwise.
- Humility and honesty. Honesty is a big source of Suck when being good. It means that any wrong doing on your part (or your friends') must be revealed. Worse, it means denying [Protagonist-Centered Morality][aOKCbo5i] and obeying the law. The character may find that to do what is right means going against stupid laws, becoming a wanted man, separated from loved ones, with their "reputation" ruined.
- Doing the right thing [doesn't always mean it's the nice thing.][ztMhlBow] Often in dilemmas where the character has to choose to either [uphold a moral standard or being kind to others][bWAgnBWy]. Whether it's [doing nasty deeds to save someone's life][YGNGBEYQ], [telling an uncomfortable truth][18PU4GFQ], or [guiding someone harshly in order for them to learn][54IWu3oC], the character will have to go against their kind nature and [do what they have to do][iMPY3dXV] for the sake of doing what's right. [The character will not enjoy this at all][zDpB1tpP]. This may cause other characters to [hate and resent the hero for making tough decisions that he is morally obligated to do.][H6vo70fb]
- [Redemption][pxjLU0pC]: A character realizing that [Being Evil Sucks][ec5eYFzD] will turn to the side of good, only to find out that it comes at a price since [Redemption Equals Affliction][ZKsOnQc8]. This means the character has to put aside their ego and acknowledge that they are in the wrong, accept their karmic punishment, and [work hard to regain the trust and respect from others][xLN8s7lM], even if people [aren't willing to forgive][YrtmCPii] or [at least forget][gOOIMLT3] what they've done.
- Giving up on a [Love Interest][g5UW20mm], [so that they can be truly happy with someone else][a0L4SBa9], or somewhere else, or doing something else. You may end up with [someone else][xEK6iyGA]...or you may end up a [Celibate Hero][kJtVuD5d] or dead.
- Giving up some comfort because someone else has a [Greater Need Than Mine][Y6D1SZHa].
- Saving people, even if they don't deserve it. Whether the person in need of saving is [The Bully][eTmrZlC8], [Alpha Bitch][d1dXqtxz], [a group of characters who hate and mistreat the hero][RU743ugo], or even [the villain][Fj9lD7eb], the hero must suck it up and lend a hand to his enemies and rivals, and [refusing to save them and let them suffer their fate][506UdW5S] is a huge no no. It doesn't matter if they [continue to show him zero respect after being saved][QAB0JdJP], the hero must keep on saving them whether they like it or not.
- Achieving a goal by doing things the honorable way. By honorable, we mean that the character must understand that [Evil Is Easy][Q5ZhLSnP], and he must work at the crack of dawn, avoid taking shortcuts, [avoid the temptation of doing things that would jeopardize their morals as well as the people around them][s6JXoiA3], and [declining any offer of success given to them all in the name of hard work.][0vLLKD4l]

At times, it can lock characters into [Status Quo Is God][iITZpECc], where success requires an evil action, making winning and staying good impossible.

On the other side of the fence, this crops up when [Evil Feels Good][TtFBR8xz]. Often applies to a [Heel–Face Turn][pxjLU0pC] character, or a hero who laments that they have to save somebody they hate from a burning building, or they don't get to kill their most hated enemy, because that's the "heroic" decision.

In a [Crapsack World][YkY7ChsG], this trope applies to a great degree but being *anything* in such a world generally sucks.

[Contrast][SkVwaub4] [Being Evil Sucks][ec5eYFzD]. Also, see [Downer Ending][waeWSybt], or, if you're lucky, [Earn Your Happy Ending][AlRJQJWE]. Compare [No Good Deed Goes Unpunished][BW1IsYBy], where the good action (rather than the process of being good) is what gets the characters in trouble. May result in someone expressing [Sympathy for the Hero][e15IP9ol]. Contrast [Karma Houdini Warranty][jLnlB0Kz], where trying to turn over a new leaf can bring down heaven's wrath. This is one way people become an [Iron Woobie][JydrG4lk] or a [Knight In Sour Armor][YaxH59dw], depending on whether the suffering is taken with quiet dignity or grumpy complaining. This belief is the original mentality of a [Moral Pragmatist][W5DNEIW6] before a [Heel–Face Turn][pxjLU0pC] or someone tries to [Cut Lex Luthor a Check][OES0C47H], but they may wind up here again if they're proven right.

There are many instances in real life in which being 'good' doesn't suck that much. Scientifically, deeds perceived as good - whether or not they are good - entail social recognition and approval, and bad deeds entail reprisal. Most villains or villainous groups might also view their actions as 'good' in some sense, however, and therefore it might be unclear that this counts as 'good' in the same sense as a story with an author-determined moral compass. Justice is one of the fundamental evolutionary imperatives that allows human society to function coherently; we may not all be saints, but we're not all lawless murderers. Unless you're a [Villain with Good Publicity][d5trDc71] It's usually more profitable to abide by society's rules, and even in that case you could be best off being [Affably Evil][PKszKpuQ]. However, the more you could influence perception in such a context, the less it would matter here whether or not you were evil. Of course, multiple societies might have different and often conflicting moral codes, even within their own confines; further, if people like Karl Marx (himself a 'villain' to some, but not all) are to be believed, the conflict within societies can sometimes be such as to give rise to fundamentally opposed forces and force recourse to struggle. Further, moral codes change over time, and this occasionally leads to conflicts between earlier morality and new trends. As a result, a simplistic application of the story-telling categories of 'villains' and 'heroes' from fiction to real life might be worth avoiding, when it comes to this trope.

            <Text>Mortimer Reece is a bounty-hunter who only wants to serve his country. His goal is to capture Ephraim Biggs and bring him to justice for an alleged murder and treason. He is confronted with Biggs’ discovery of advanced weapons and Pontiac’s Rebellion, and realizes that these advanced weapons are a godsend for the British.
Story: Mortimer is a bounty-hunter called to retrieve the fugitive Ephraim Biggs. He tracks Biggs to TOWN where the trail goes cold after Jeffry’s refusal to help. The trail picks up again when he hears from a Solomon that Biggs is in Philadelphia. He captures Biggs and gets into a squabble with Jeffry over Ephraim’s (lack of) trial. When they hear of Pontiac’s War, he agrees to lobby for Ephraim’s freedom in exchange for the weapons (a ruse by the authorities that Mortimer detects), then the two join forces to lift the siege of Ft. Pitt.</Text>

Bigg’s Rifle is an 8-round en-bloc top-fed .308 caliber rifle with an injection molded polycarbonate, glass-filled stock. It has a 45 centimeter (17.7") barrel. It is remarkably similar to the M1 Tanker variant.
Harper’s Ferry Model 1803 (HFM ’03 or Aught-3) is a near-perfect replica of the Bigg’s Rifle, but with a walnut stock.

His goal in the story is to coordinate the apprehension of Ephraim Biggs and quiet the Sons of Liberty. He is confronted by the fantastic weaponry and realizes this is his path to prestige.
Story: Warren Boydell is a government customs agent and coordinator of British espionage in Philadelphia. He sets Mortimer on his task (officer slept with Mrs. Boydell) and is frustrated when Mortimer turns up empty-handed. He hears from his mole that Ephraim is in Philadelphia, and gets word to Mortimer to come get him (he holds back part of the reward to each man). He is amazed by the new weaponry and lantern, and sends them to London, which triggers the series.</Text>

Fort Lyttleton (1)
Fort Lyttleton (1) (1756-1764) - A French &amp; Indian War Fort established in 1756 near the present day town of Fort Littleton in Fulton County, Pennsylvania. Named Fort Lyttleton after Sir George Lyttleton, British chancellor of the exchequer (1755-56). Fort Abandoned in 1764. Also known as Fort Littleton.
History of Fort Lyttleton (1)

Construction began in December 1755 by George Croghan of a 100 foot square stockade with bastions at each of the four corners. Initially garrisoned by 75 Pennsylvania troops.
Used as one of the supply forts along the Forbes Road in the successful 1758 campaign by British General John Forbes to capture the French Fort Duquesne. Garrisoned by British and Provincial troops until 1760 and generally abandoned until briefly reoccupied in 1763 by local volunteers during the Pontiac's War.
Abandoned and in ruins by 1764.

KEY LOCATIONS lays out the central narrative spaces in the series, the recurring locations that are important to the characters and the world and the dominant locations where the story will play out.
In a good series these Locations will not be arbitrary - they will be specifically chosen for their natural dramatic pressures, their stylistic or aesthetic significance to the narratives, or their metaphoric relationship to characters, contexts and themes.
This section should list the locations and provide a 1-2 paragraph description of each.</Text>

### Absent Aliens

*"I remember telling my college professor I wanted to study Xenoarcheology. He laughed right in my face. 'There’s nothing to study,' he said. 'It’s all dead space. No alien life exists out in the universe.' In a way, I guess he was right..."*

Humanity has [explored the galaxy, and in some stories the universe][FsNUD7SB], and it turns out the truth *isn't* out there. There are no aliens, or at least, no intelligent ones.

**Done for a variety of reasons:**

- Not every sci-fi plot requires aliens.
- Avoids [Rubber-Forehead Aliens][GqX8Vioh], and saves having to think up decent [Starfish Aliens][xlF6LiU0].
- Isolates humanity in the depressing void of space.
- Saves on the effects budget.
- Makes it easier to make characters [relatable and believable][EG3VzInS].
- Is consistent with the fact that no aliens have yet been found. (See [Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness][2sEX3v1f].)
- Even if aliens did theoretically exist, in settings where the population is confined to a single star system and there is no FTL, neither humanity nor the aliens would be in any position to encounter the other.
- Theoretically, intelligence could be a rare evolutionary fluke, rare at least elsewhere in the Milky Way. Even if intelligence evolves on other planets, it may be extinct by the time humans leave the Solar System, or alternatively, humanity could be extinct by the time aliens leave *their* home system. Thus, even interstellar civilizations may be separated by immense distances or timescales, and unlikely to interact.
- The focus of the Sci-Fi in question is a political struggle between human populations, and aliens could either help them resolve their differences or serve as a threat encouraging them to do so themselves.
- Is free of the [Unfortunate Implications][r8KSGfxj] that cultures that spent time building monuments and functioning societies [lacked the intelligence to do things like that on their own][7tzNe2qF], or that "low-tech" is synonymous with "backwards".
- Raises the [Driving Question][zERAZ2L5] of what happened to the aliens, and whether humanity could be next.

There may be a few cursory alien plants and rodents or perhaps a [Monster of the Week][rX7Nq7OF], which is generally filled by humans, genetically engineered monsters, and robots. An ongoing work does not have to stay this way; it can provide a [Game Changer][LjioIOaM] with [First Contact][KCTXBOEj] when the writers need to shake things up.

One of two standard solutions to the [Fermi Paradox][Wuwb29XT]; the other is [Invisible Aliens][ssGcqtp7], in which aliens exist but are being hidden or removed by [Applied Phlebotinum][UIWzLzRL].

            <Title>Ephraim rejected by brother</Title>
            <Synopsis>EPHRAIM BIGGS is a Son of Liberty on the lamb. In the rain, he arrives at his brother's JEFFRY BIGGS home in SHIPPENSBERG, PA. Once inside and warmed, he asks his brother to shelter him. In the conversation, they argue over why he was there, which leads into the Sons of Liberty and the real reason why Ephraim is on the run. He refuses his brother, and the next morning Ephraim leaves.
</Synopsis>
            <Text>Chapter One
Tuesday, September 14, 1762. It was a dark and stormy night. Ephraim Biggs stood under the building’s eave as rivulets of rain poured over its edge. Between lightening flashes, he could see the lane ahead. Puddles of brown rain collected and formed a small stream. Four more doors.
Ephraim hued up and bolted down the lane. A nearby bolt of lightening flashed and thunder roared at the same time. The nearness scared him. He dove into a mud puddle. As suddenly as the lightening came, Ephraim felt foolish. Franklin’s experiments assured him he would not be struck with so many buildings nearby.
He stood and shook himself off. He picked up his bag and continued down the lane. After two steps, he stopped. Mud on his face oozed toward his eyes. He looked up into the rain, letting the water help him wash the mud from his face away.
Soaked to the bone, he stopped running down the lane. It was a cold, dark rain, but in a few minutes he would be warm and dry.
He walked up to the house that the keeper at Widow Piper’s Tavern said belonged to Jeffry Biggs. Light cracked through the shutters signaling they were still awake. He straightened his coat. With his fist, he pounded on the door. He waited a few moments, then repeated his pounding.
The door opened. Jeffry Biggs pointed a flintlock pistol at Ephraim. “Who is it?”
Ephraim looked at the pistol. It was at half-cock, the primer pan down. “Your brother, Jeffry.”
“I don’t have a brother named Jeffry.”
“Don’t be an ass. It’s me, Ephraim.”
Jeffry hesitated before tilting the pistol up. He grabbed the hammer with his thumb and decocked the pistol. Ephraim flinched. It was a bad habit their father taught both of them, with consequences Ephraim was familiar with. At least Jeffry pointed the barrel away safely. “Not like that.” The correct way is to blow the powder out of the pan.
Ephraim removed his hat before he crossed the threshold. He shook the rain off of it. He handed it over to Jeffry. He then took off his long coat, still covered in mud.
Jeffry motioned to a chair on the porch. “Leave that on the chair. We’ll take care of that in the morning.”
Ephraim lay the coat across the chair’s arms. He looked back at his brother to see if there was anything else he needed to do.
“Enter.”
Ephraim crossed the threshold. The house was warm. The faint wood smoke at the fire coaxed Ephraim to relax for the first time in a week.
“Barbara, would you mind warming up some soup?”
Jeffry’s wife Barbara set down her needlework. “Certainly. Good evening, Ephraim.” As she stood, Ephraim noticed the slight bulge that would be a new niece or nephew. He was there when their first was stillborn. Peggy and Jeffry junior would be asleep upstairs.
He started to shiver. “Evening.” Without asking, he moved a nearby three-legged stool closer to the fire and sat.
“Do you need a blanket?” she said.
He shook his head. “Rum?”
Jeffry said, “I’ll get that.” He went to a cabinet to get a mug and the rum.
Barbara moved a near-empty pot of soup back onto the fire. “We just finished a short while ago, so it won’t take long.
Jeffry handed the rum to Ephraim, and stood back. Ephraim could feel the—it was not quite a glare or a stare. It was that annoyed look Jeffry had when they were younger. It was a familiar look.
Ephraim preferred to sip the rum to warm him and let the fire slowly dry him.
After a bit, Jeffry sat at the table. He put his glasses on and picked up his quill and started reading. He made notes as he went. Every few moments, he would pause and glance toward Ephraim before returning to his work.
Barbara gave Ephraim some soup, then resumed her needlework.
It was thin. Either they had eaten all the best parts, or business was not thriving at the edge of civilization.
It remained quiet for quite some time. Ephraim finished the soup and milked the rum. His clothes dried up. Most of the mud was on the longcoat on the porch.
Jeffry set down the papers, quill and glasses. “Alright, what’s all this?”
Ephraim noted frustration and exasperation in his voice.
Ephraim took another sip of rum to buy a few more seconds. He thought through what he had rehearsed en route. He never found a way to make it sound less incriminating.
“I need a place to stay a while.”
“You have a place. Philadelphia.”
“I’m thinking of moving West a bit. Or South. Philadelphia is a bit too modern. Right? That’s why you left.”
“I left because there were too many lawyers there, and not enough here. As soon as the wilderness is opened up they will need lawyers.”
Ephraim mumbled, “people go West to avoid lawyers.”
“What’s that?”
“I said that’s very enterprising of you. I’m sure Pennsylvanians will find comfort in knowing the law is with them in the wilderness. Maybe you can lawyer your way into subduing the savages.”
“You mean the Shawnee? The Cherokee? Many of them are adopting our modes of dress and law. Some are starting to write in their own language. Being out here—I think I can help subdue the savages with the law, as you say.” Jeffry poured rum into his own mug, then poured more into Ephraim’s.
“Don’t you think they would be happier if we stayed where we were and minded our own business?”
Jeffry laughed. “I don’t right care what they prefer. Locke was right, if they were the rightful owners of this land, it would be prosperous like England. Instead, they left it a wasteland. We English are more enterprising. We will subdue the Earth as divine law decreed. My way is more civil. Would you rather they adopt English law or French?”
Referring to the law as English grated. “You know I don’t care one way or the other.”
“Right, you don’t even agree with the appeal to divine law.”
It was a subtle barb, and one that did not get through Ephraim’s skin. “I learned all about God I needed in seminary. Look, I need a place to stay for while.”
“Why not Philadelphia? You had a place there. You had one in New York before that. New Haven was your home for a time before that.” Jeffry shook his head. “I don’t think you have a home here.”
“I’m not looking for a home. Just a place to stay while I find a home. I don’t think these crossroads are where I will end up. Although, I did not see a smith.”
Jeffry clinched his jaw. “There is a smith, and he barely makes ends meet. The Widow brings most of his work. People going down to Virginia or Carolina. Some Army going West to Fort Pitt. I don’t think another smith is what this place needs.”
“You don’t think this place could handle two Biggs?”
Jeffry smirked, “it’s Bigg enough with one. Don’t be coy.”
Ephraim feigned innocence. It was an old joke. At least Barbara smiled.
“Why are you really here?”
Ephraim finished his rum. “I just need to get away from Philadelphia, that’s all.”
Jeffry tutted. “In trouble like always? Still speaking out against the King? That’s treason, you know.”
“For speaking my mind? Don’t be daft. You watch. As soon as this instant French war is over, Americans will be clammoring for the English to leave.” Ephraim pointed at himself with this thumb. “I’m going to be one of them.”
“A Son of Liberty? You? I should have known. Always bucking authority, even at the old forge.”
It was the Jeffry’s tone that set Ephraim off. “You watch. God will grant me the power to drive the English out.” He glanced over at Barbara who pretended not to notice the conversation.
“The same God you balked at in seminary? Hardly. Maybe for spite. The Devil more like. Besides, you’re English. Good luck driving yourself out.”
“I’m American. Neither of us have ever been to England, and those lobsters are keen to remind us.”
“And what would you do if God or the Devil grants your wish? The day after the English are gone, you’ll still be Ephraim.”
The barb struck hard. “I’ll be a free Ephraim. That’s all that matters. I’ll kill anyone who tries to stop me.” 
Jeffry glared at him like their father used to. “No, you won’t. You’ll run away like you always do. I will let you stay a few days. After that, you should continue down Wagon Road.”
* * *
A few days in Shippensburg was all Ephraim needed. On the first day, he toured the town, including a survey of the puddle he had become acquainted with the night before. He was surprised to find the log stockade fort, Fort Morris. The fort was inactive, but represented English rule nonetheless. It was built to protect this part of the Wagon road during the French &amp; Indian War after Braddock was slain. Given that many of the town’s buildings, including Jeffry’s house, were made of stone, it struck Ephraim oddly that the fort was wood.
Widow’s Tavern revealed the other reason to move on. Shippensburg was a crossroads to Ohio Country. The Tavern was frequented by trappers, traders and redcoats. He could feel their eyes on him when he entered the tavern.
He needed to get further away. At least until things quieted down. Falling Springs was appealing. It had a fort, privately owned, and few settlers. It was much smaller than it used to be, which meant it may soon resettle. Ephraim worried that hostilities had only recently paused near Falling Springs and could resume. He thought Jeffry was mad to settle so close to the wilderness with Barbara and their children.</Text>
            <Comments>Spend more time in the conversation with the Biggs brother to introduce other key characters? Set their conflict as one very passionate and irrational.</Comments>
            <Notes>By the end of this scene, should arc the entire novel.

- All I want is the power to drive the English out of America
- But, you’re English
- No I’m not. I’m an American
- … from England

- What would you do if God granted you your wish, gave you the power to drive out the English? 
- Give it to the Sons…
- I’ll kill anyone who tries to stop me
- No you won’t. You’ll run away like you always do.</Notes>

            <Text>In Discovery, Kariwase is a lead Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) warrior among the Iroquois. [@IroquoisMaleNames] He wants nothing more than to purge his homeland of white settlers. His goal in the story is to pave the way for Pontiac's siege of Fort Pitt by hunting solitary white "spies." He is confronted by Biggs' access to weaponry, and realizes that those advanced weapons could spell the doom for the Iroquois nation.
Story: Kariwase hunts white hunters who find themselves in Iroquois territory as part of the preliminary action of Pontiac's Rebellion. He prologs the series by killing a white savagely, eating brains per the start of the French &amp; Indian War. He later hunts Biggs who evades him by falling into a pit. He leaves a small team to ensure Biggs doesn't escape, and is later enraged that they were killed by Biggs. He engages in counter-counter siege operations in a skirmish with the advanced-armed militia and is wounded &amp; beaten off.</Text>

            <Title>British North America Act of 1771</Title>
            <Text>British North America Act of 1771
British North America sought representation in Parliament. The government agreed, providing the colonies restructured. This act transformed the continental colonies to six self-regulated provinces: Canada, New England (some called Camelot), Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York), Virginia (includes Maryland &amp; Delaware), Carolina, &amp; Georgia. This act further gave those provincial governments representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Charlotina province is added in 1803, encompassing IRL Northwest Territory United States. Parliament calculated this reorganization of the colonies into provinces would create internal tension that would allow England to retain control.
This created frustration among the joined colonies (NY, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island &amp; Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New Hampshire), especially RI&amp;PP as they sought to be more tolerant religiously than Massachusetts. This is an example of Parliament’s intentional friction within the provinces.

Season one
Starts with him in an escape pod hurling toward the alien planet, fading into/out-of conscious. Echoing in his mind are the words “you promised” shrieked by his wife from when he told her in the parking lot he would not refuse the two-year assignment on the observation orbital.
… This is because his biggest regret is lying to her and going…that he has had a son he never met.

Summary
Albert Strand, protagonist
is the descendent of one of the Slipstream discoverers. His drive to honor the family legacy leads him to turn his back on his new family and spend two years on a research orbital. As his tour wraps up, his orbital is attacked by anarchists, forcing him to abandon ship. The ship inexplicably navigates straight to the surface below. He crashes. He awakes hostage on an alien world. He uses his knowledge of advanced technology to survive. He tries desperately to develop the means to return home while trying to maneuver in the real war on the alien planet. But, he must keep the alien humans from mastering the technology and awaking the real threat to his homeworld.
Adomas Galliulin - Alien ruler - Country, Antagonist
wants to dominate his wee continent. He paints himself as the victim and tries to seduce Albert (whom he calls “Herbert”, which is a play on words) to support him with newfangled weapons. He wants a doomsday weapon. He is “Country.”
Tongo Rad - Alien scientist - Duty
works for AR. He’s assigned to help with the doomsday weapon and steal ideas from Albert. His fanatical dedication to AR is slowly eroded by his interaction with Albert. He decides (or pretends to) help Albert get home. He is “Duty.”
Irina Galliulin - Alien princess - Honor
is AR’s daughter. She falls in love with Albert and wants him to fall in love with her. She is “Honor.”
Dr. Strand - Albert’s Father - Country
wants to keep his domination of industry. When his son is reported missing, he is split between serving his company and saving his son who is probably dead. “I have another.”
Michael Richards - Albert’s “best” Friend - Duty
was with him when they were attacked, and helped Albert escape. We learn early on this was a ruse to get rid of Albert so that his friend could go after the widow…
Charles Napier - Albert’s true best Friend - Duty
with him before being sent home. He is the action between the Father &amp; Wife…while the Father comes to want his son home, he can’t do the work.
Mabel Downey - Albert’s wife &amp; Family - Honor
she is heartbroken when he left, and mourns when she finds him reported missing. She is suspicious of the friend, especially after he clearly makes advances to him. She is the steel that pushes Father to do something, and develops to be a force to be reckoned with.
Clarance Dankworth
Hot-headed Ulster orphan who managed to get into a public school with Albert and became “Blaster” to Albert’s “Master.” He replaces Charles as the unofficial Strand guardian. He is strand along with Albert.
Slora Hanlon
Thrown into prison the episode after Albert and after Mabel prays for Albert. He’s the mentor.

Clarance Dankworth
John Reid former name
Clarance is “Blaster” to Albert’s “Master,” and the reason why they had to flee New Briton Orbital. He is read and willing to fight, and has a knack for being proficient in any weapon. During the first season, he is such a loyal companion of Albert’s that the natives haul him away to kill him…Rasputin style. He manages to survive, later coming back with a rebel army of sorts as an effort to save Albert. Fiercely loyal to Albert.
Mabel Sevrin
Albert’s “child” bride. Michael was pursuing her when she fell in love with Albert at first sight. She was raped and impregnated by an unknown assailant (Michael, who thought this would scare Albert off).

Key Locations
KEY LOCATIONS lays out the central narrative spaces in the series, the recurring locations that are important to the characters and the world and the dominant locations where the story will play out.
In a good series these Locations will not be arbitrary - they will be specifically chosen for their natural dramatic pressures, their stylistic or aesthetic significance to the narratives, or their metaphoric relationship to characters, contexts and themes.
This section should list the locations and provide a 1-2 paragraph description of each.
Crown Victoria Orbital
Crown Victoria Orbital is a precursor orbital in geostationary orbit over British North America. The English occupied it (10-15 years) before Season 3 start and use it for a base to study Precursor space technology.

            <Text>#### Neutrino Energy

Neutrino energy is a theoretical way of converting the kinetic energy of cosmic into into direct current (DC) electricity.
The energy is converted by layers a conductive film, silicone film and graphene film. The conductive film comprises silver, gold, copper, gallium or aluminum or one of their alloys, in particular of a silver or gold alloy or an aluminum-gallium alloy. Each film layer is very fine, measured in 100s of nanometers. See Neutrino Power Cube[sec:neutrino-power-cube] for the scientific application.

IRL Research:

* The neutrino is the source of abundant, clean, renewable energy.[^nutrino-energy]
* Neutrinovoltaic - a low voltage system of 12/24/48V DC
* **Neutrino Film** is "a film made of metal or a metal alloy, in particular a film made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a so-called neutrino or ntrino film (registered trademarks), to a method of production and to a use of a film made of metal or a metal alloy." [^WO2016142056A1]
* **Neutrino Power Cubes** are highly sophisticated power cells that have the advantage of being able to supply energy in complete darkness. They do this by harnessing the kinetic energy created by invisible waves of cosmic radiation, transforming it into micro-vibrations in a complex resonation process facilitated by super-symmetrical coatings on a stable substrate. And because these power cells can be stacked on top of one another, they are more compact and efficient than today’s solar cells and far less easily damaged.[^Neutrino-energy]
* **Neutrino Energy Harvesting** is when energy can be derived from many different sources such as radio waves, vibrations, heat, or light, and these sources can be either natural or artificial. Solar cells convert light; thermoelectric generators convert heat flux (temperature differences); and Neutrino Power Cubes convert vibrations caused by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos into electricity.[^Neutrino-Wiki]

Story: Ephraim killed a British officer and was found guilty, only to escape and flee to the edge of society seeking refuge with his brother. Jeffry refuses, but also gives him lead time to flee into the wilderness, where Ephraim is pursued by Indians and falls into the Temple. With advanced weapons in hand, he tries to get them to Sons of Liberty, only to be captured by Mortimer. When Pontiac's Rebellion is known, he relents to his brother's pressure to surrender the location of the temple (and take Mortimer &amp; militia there) to get more weapons to lift the seige of Ft. Pitt. In compensation, Mortimer lets Ephraim free by agreeing to say he was killed in the fighting. Ephraim decides to go to South Carolina under an assumed name, but murders &amp; robs Solomon Sharpe first.</Text>

            <Text>&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
&gt; Discuss actual trends in African Slavery in Britain in this era.

Without the American Revolution, the anti-slavery movement in England starts earlier. Over this 50-year period (1772-1848), slavery was eliminated throughout the British Empire.

* 1772 - Somerset's Case holds there is no basis for slavery in English law, and held that laws supporting slavery were against Natural Law. This extends to BNA.
* 1787 - Wilberforce's Anti-Slavery Society struggled against London Society of West India Planters and Merchants who fought against abolition of slavery.
* 1807 - During a break in the French Troubles, England de-legalizes trans-shipment of slaves on the Oceans and between non-connected provinces.
* 1833 - "Apprenticeship Act of 1833" ends slavery in all British holdings by stages &amp; "apprenticeships." Chattel is immediately repudiated by Parliament, meaning that African children were born free. Slave owners were mollified by a tax break for each freeborn child. Slave owners were compensated by tax. American high-society slave owners were well-compensated, lower-class owners were not, leading to some animosity. Increased investment in Toltec technology helps blunt the need for slaves during the Apprenticeship Period (1833-1846).
* 1846-48 - Apprenticeships ended in American provinces (Virginia, Carolina, Georgia) to increase representation in Parliament, leading to local civil conflicts in each province by the lower class "masters," which was put down by General Scott.

            <Title>1763-1783: Point of Divergence</Title>
            <Text>1763-1783: Point of Divergence
From the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until the end of the Seven Year’s War of 1763, a philosophical and political rift occurred both in America and Britain. Americans viewed Locke’s Second Treatise of Government as a blueprint for social change. The British viewed it as wasted paper. Benign neglect from the 1720s to 1740s resulted in colonists assuming more control for their affairs; home rule de jure. This neglect was shattered during the Seven Year’s War, but Americans exploited the crisis with their more sophisticated understanding of politics and emerged from the War debt-free and ready to assert its independence. In England, Parliament weakened the Crown’s control over politics and the prerogative system, nearly reducing the Crown to a figurehead. George III subverted that trend by taking control of Parliament in the years between his coronation in 1760 and the end of the War in 1763.
Saddled with war debt and the need to protect North America, George’s Parliament enacted the Sugar Act, which reduced the tax on molasses. Americans rioted and decried this as an intrusion into its home rule. The period known as the American Troubles (1763-67) were pivotal in stabilizing British-American relations and establishing the modern British Commonwealth. During the Troubles, Crown and Parliament exploited American internecine jealousies and prejudices to prevent this strain from flaring into mutiny. George recognized the threat to stability and had Parliament invite American colonies to send delegates to negotiate. An agreement similar to the earlier home rule “Albany Plan” pitched by Benjamin Franklin in 1755 was agreed upon. The Stamp Act of 1765 &amp; Declaratory Act of 1766 never occur. Timelines diverge. OTL: The watershed period from 1763-1767 divided America and Britain. The Proclamation in 1763, the Sugar Act in 1764, Stamp Act of 1765 and its repeal / Declaratory Act of 1766 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 progressively strained and broke relations. As cold hostilities turned to hot war, moderates sought to halt the separation until by the 1777 Battle of Saratoga it became clear no reunification was possible. Read @millerOriginsAmericanRevolution1943.
Toltec weaponry thwarted Pontiac’s Rebellion in Summer of 1763, which prevented the Declaratory Act from being enacted. Instead, King George sends a full regiment to ensure the Ohio is retained and negotiations for American home rule started. REMOVE
In 1765, Parliament invited a delegation from each of the mainland colonies to work out differences that included Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. This extended negotiation (1765-68) blunted Radical demands for independence. However, a splinter from the Sons of Liberty continued the (now unpopular) fight for American Independence. This splinter movement is a key area of conflict in Discovery Season.
These negotiations led to legislation that addressed British North America grievances and allowed both sides of the Atlantic to move forward in a tense harmony.

            <Text>Absent Aliens
“I remember telling my college professor I wanted to study Xenoarcheology. He laughed right in my face. ‘There’s nothing to study,’ he said. ‘It’s all dead space. No alien life exists out in the universe.’ In a way, I guess he was right…”
Humanity has explored the galaxy, and in some stories the universe, and it turns out the truth isn’t out there. There are no aliens, or at least, no intelligent ones.
Done for a variety of reasons:
•	Not every sci-fi plot requires aliens.
•	Avoids Rubber-Forehead Aliens, and saves having to think up decent Starfish Aliens.
•	Isolates humanity in the depressing void of space.
•	Saves on the effects budget.
•	Makes it easier to make characters relatable and believable.
•	Is consistent with the fact that no aliens have yet been found. (See Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness.)
•	Even if aliens did theoretically exist, in settings where the population is confined to a single star system and there is no FTL, neither humanity nor the aliens would be in any position to encounter the other.
•	Theoretically, intelligence could be a rare evolutionary fluke, rare at least elsewhere in the Milky Way. Even if intelligence evolves on other planets, it may be extinct by the time humans leave the Solar System, or alternatively, humanity could be extinct by the time aliens leave their home system. Thus, even interstellar civilizations may be separated by immense distances or timescales, and unlikely to interact.
•	The focus of the Sci-Fi in question is a political struggle between human populations, and aliens could either help them resolve their differences or serve as a threat encouraging them to do so themselves.
•	Is free of the Unfortunate Implications that cultures that spent time building monuments and functioning societies lacked the intelligence to do things like that on their own, or that “low-tech” is synonymous with “backwards”.
•	Raises the Driving Question of what happened to the aliens, and whether humanity could be next.
There may be a few cursory alien plants and rodents or perhaps a Monster of the Week, which is generally filled by humans, genetically engineered monsters, and robots. An ongoing work does not have to stay this way; it can provide a Game Changer with First Contact when the writers need to shake things up.
One of two standard solutions to the Fermi Paradox; the other is Invisible Aliens, in which aliens exist but are being hidden or removed by Applied Phlebotinum.</Text>

            <Title>Crapsack World</Title>
            <Text>Crapsack World
No hope. No release. No end.
A Crapsack World is a horrible setting where the jaded notion of “anything that can go wrong will go horribly wrong” almost always applies, and it corrupts its inhabitants into perpetuating that nastiness against each other. More succinctly, trying to survive in one of these places is gonna suck.
Although there are countless ways Crapsack Worlds can be depicted (often with Scenery Gorn), it is usually dark, and on the cynical end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, so it will have either Grey and Gray Morality or Black and Gray Morality, if not outright Evil vs. Evil in the worst of cases (beware of Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy if you decide to go this route though). Settings like these are not kind at all to idealists, who usually get traumatized and/or die horribly when their attempts to change the world through idealism meet tragic ends.
Heroes in this setting are usually Anti Heroes, and often have at least a bit of the Deadpan Snarker about them. Being good will suck, and if there are genuinely good heroes in this setting, expect them to be Knights In Sour Armor and/or Hurting Heroes—more idealistic heroes such as the Knight in Shining Armor tend to not last long in this kind of setting. Any victories they manage to win over the forces of this world are likely to be Pyrrhic in nature.
Villains tend to run the gamut from sympathetic Anti Villains (on any level of the Sliding Scale of Anti-Villains) right down to the most horrific monsters to grace any kind of media. Truly awful villains are especially common in these kinds of settings, both to represent the misery of the setting in general and to give the Anti-Hero someone to whom he can look good in comparison. In truly extreme cases, even the most popular or powerful of these monsters suffer just as badly as everyone else. And Anyone Can Die.
From here, these worlds can be depicted by authors in various ways, whether it would be dramatic or comedic, immutable or mutable. Though most of the time immutable equals dramatic, it is possible to see combinations between these categories.
•	A dramatic Crapsack World has plenty of angst to go around, and often makes Woobies out of its sympathetic cast, particularly the protagonist, as they suffer horribly in their attempts to do the right thing or pursue their dreams. Expect characters who do the right thing to suffer for it. Expect characters who do the wrong thing to prosper… and then suffer. Examples: New World of Darkness, Old World of Darkness, Sin City, and Neon Genesis Evangelion.
•	A comedic Crapsack World is Played for Laughs and is made up of idiots, jerks, Butt Monkeys, Chew Toys and the occasional Only Sane Man, with plenty of Comedic Sociopathy to go around. These include the Black Comedy, the Sadist Show and the World Gone Mad. The “upside” is that it’s usually parodic and funny in its extremes. Though people die left and right, it likely has Negative Continuity to facilitate the inhabitants’ suffering. Maybe a Crapsaccharine World. Examples: Invader Zim, Ed, Edd n Eddy, Happy Tree Friends, The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show, Rocko’s Modern Life, The Simpsons, Family Guy, Matt ‘n’ Dusty, Drawn Together, and South Park. Paranoia is not an example of this in the slightest.
•	An immutable Crapsack World has agony Inherent in the System, both physically and metaphysically, and cannot be saved or made a better place. Trying to break The Corruption will instead always result in breaking every bone in your body and it winning, and any positive changes that you try to make will ultimately be torn down and revealed to be All for Nothing—or, even worse, they will only succeed in making things even worse for you and the people that you were trying to help, and/or even accomplish whatever the villains wanted in the first place. Examples: Nineteen Eighty-Four, Warhammer 40,000, FATAL, and the Lovecraftian Fiction genre in general.
•	A mutable Crapsack World simply starts out as crappy, but a determined protagonist and his True Companions, be they the Knight In Shining (or in many of these cases, Sour) Armor or a simple old PI, can actually cause some, but mostly few, positive changes in the setting. See also A World Half Full. Examples: Elysium, Fallout, Mad Max, and Waterworld.
This kind of world often occurs After the End. Wretched Hive and City Noir are city-sized versions of the Crapsack World. A Dystopia is a speculative Crapsack World ruled by repressive forces modeled after real-life politics. A Teenage Wasteland is a Crapsack World run by kids. If the Crapsack World’s continued misery is caused by supernatural forces, see Dark Fantasy, Hell on Earth and Cosmic Horror Story.
If a Sugar Bowl (usually the antithesis of this trope) turns out to be one of these under the surface, then you have yourself a Crapsaccharine World. If the people who live in the Crapsack World don’t realise or pretend it isn’t a horrible place to be in, it is a False Utopia. A Villain World or Death World is likely to be this, and Bad Future is a Sub-Trope. Someone who just thinks the world they inhabit is this is a Cynic or a Straw Nihilist (or a Grumpy Bear, if he lives in a pretty nice world).
For worlds that are almost literal sacks of crap see The Dung Ages. See You Would Not Want to Live in Dex for other crapsack environments. On a less negative note, the World of Badass will also be likely to have elements of the Crapsack World, to give justification on why kicking ass is very important to survival. Compare World of Jerkass, a world which is only unpleasant because all of the characters are horrible people.
This trope is also known as World Half Empty, for the expression of pessimism being a state of seeing a glass with half the amount of water in it as being “half empty”. Also, a half-empty glass means it can only be emptied, and can’t be refilled. It represents hopelessness and inevitable doom, fitting this trope perfectly. By definition, contrast A World Half Full. C.T. Phipps talks about some of the appeal to the concept here. The Appeal of Grimdark.</Text>

### America is Still a Colony

If there was a failed revolution, then it's quite likely that the colonies will have suffered some sort of harsh reprisals, and may still be living under some sort of [stern martial law](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppressiveStatesOfAmerica). In this case, expect to find [La Résistance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance) going strong.

The colonists will often retain stereotypically British traits, such as accentsnote , even though those traits were not actually affected by the war, but by distance, and, in many cases, were already somewhat established by the time the war occurred. This may be done to help remind the viewer that things are different in this timeline, or it may simply be [Rule of Funny](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny).

In any case, expect mention of [Historical Domain Characters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter) like [George Washington](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington), [Thomas Jefferson](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson), and [Benjamin Franklin](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin), in much different roles from the ones they played in our history. They may be branded as traitors, or simply remembered for much different things.note  Benedict Arnold's name will no longer be a synonym for [Turncoat](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Turncoat), and may even be a term of praise. Paul Revere will be remembered for his work as a silversmith, rather than for the midnight ride immortalized by the poet Longfellow.

[Sub-Trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope) of [Different States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentStatesOfAmerica).

See also the [Divided States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedStatesOfAmerica), where the US never unified or the union broke up at some point; the [Fallen States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenStatesOfAmerica), where the US has become a third world country; the [Invaded States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvadedStatesOfAmerica), where the US has either been invaded or outright conquered; and the [Expanded States of America](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedStatesOfAmerica), where the US has gotten bigger.

Because of (TRAGEDY), he needs to prove that (LIE). He fears that (FEAR) and will (FLAW / COMPETING) to prevent it.
Henry Strand (1760-1844) is the brother of David Strand. He attended Yale College after his brother then read law at Litchfield Law School. He moved to Meadville, Crawford County, PA where he set up a law practice. He invested in iron furnaces there and started a local paper. When his brother arrived a few years later, he set him up as foreman for the furnances, unaware of the Bigelow murder. When Hale &amp; Montresor arrive, he grows suspicious, but he helps his brother escape. He then undermines the investigation leaving Hale &amp; Montresor frustrated and deciding to go home.

##### Chandler Neutrino Power Cube {#sec:neutrino-power-cube}

**Johnathan Link Chandler** was the first to reverse engineer the Toltec Neutrino Engine (called Annichites by the Toltec), creating the Chandler Neutrino Power Cell, and Power Cubes. The NVPC (Neutrino-voltaic Power Cube) is a 2.25" cube. Chandler encased them in a thin layer of white porcelain with four brass electrodes flush with the body. This allows the cubes to be tethered to create the larger power cubes.

### Giving Radio to the Romans

"*...we now live in a world where kings and noblemen rule the roost. And they've turned all of central Europe — **our home, now, ours and our childrens' to come** — into a raging inferno. We are surrounded by a Ring of Fire. Well, I've fought forest fires before. So have lots of other men in this room. The best way to fight a fire is to start a counterfire. So my position is simple. I say we start the American Revolution — a hundred and fifty years ahead of schedule!*"

The problem with the past is that it's so uncivilized, but any time traveler worth their salt can fix that. Just introduce it to the delights of modern technology, several centuries early. You may need to go through a few intermediate stages, replicating the history of technology on fast forward, but you know exactly what needs doing. How difficult can it be?

There are two types of time travelers who try this stunt - the unwilling ones, [Trapped in the Past][askHV3lK] with [just the right skills needed to jump start the industrial revolution][5L3MU579], and the reckless ones who don't care about paradoxes, they just want to rewrite history for the better.

Either way, this is a long term plan. Even optimistic heroes will expect to take a few years to get the desired results. Realistic ones will consider it a lifetime's work. The hero can't leap straight to modern technology; [they have to get the past society to go through all the intermediate steps first][S3PpCKJX], or they won't have the necessary tools to make the tools to do the job. As such, this is typically the plot of an entire book, or even a series.

[Ancient Astronauts][9fxRzT6A] and explorers rediscovering [lost colonies][M0WCmQYS] occasionally fall into the trope, if the story goes into detail about how they introduce technological advances, but they normally gloss that over. By contrast, works in this subgenre typically go into great details about the new technologies being introduced to the past, and their social impact, as well as addressing all the problems that would realistically crop up.

If the strand party has a phone to a high-tech society, whether in the future or on another world, this trope can still apply. The phone can provide them with all the information they need, but they still have to deal with the immense practical problems involved in getting from medieval to modern technology. It would still take decades to get 14th century England from church bells to digital clocks, even with an internet connection to the present day, and the full resources of the kingdom at your disposal. However, if the strand party can get actual physical objects from their high-tech friends, the difficulties melt away, and this trope does not apply.

If a Hero succeeds, there's still a risk of [going horribly wrong][PNef0Ya1], [going horribly right][eruRVYhM], or both.

If the Hero went back in time with the purpose of using this trope to change history (such as preventing the Fall of Constantinople by going back to 1453 and giving the city's defenders modern weaponry and teaching them modern tactics), then it also counts as trying to [Set Right What Once Went Wrong][Hw8k4SGW] (or [Make Wrong What Once Went Right][WLyUScor], depending on the perspective).

[Fridge Logic][jB2Md24t] would dictate that this would result in an infinite technological loop: Suppose the radio was invented back in 50 B.C. by a time traveler. Since this means that time travel is possible, eventually somebody from the future of the timeline created by the original time traveler would travel back to an even earlier time (for example, 800 B.C.) and give radio to the Akkadians or something. Then a time traveler from *that* timeline would introduce radio even father back, repeating until the very first generation of humans ever to evolve is given advanced technology and civilization.

#### Compare with:

- [A Little Something We Call "Rock and Roll"][CbKXuNTf]: When this is done with pop culture instead of technology.
- [Low Culture, High Tech][p1wJgfgd]: Will result if the time traveler *doesn't* lay the groundwork for the low tech people to properly replicate the future tech.

#### Contrast with:

- [This Is My Boomstick][qwhaYt80]: The Hero only wants to impress the locals short-term.
- [Cargo Cult][57JA3WmL]: The primitive culture gets technology but concludes that the artifact is a god.

### Knight in Sour Armor

When life gives you lemons...note

The world is filled with [Wide Eyed Idealists][8qlXdrXV] who believe in truth and justice and devote their lives to fighting for it. And then the [dark, cruel and brutal world][HgZAHQwy] keeps letting them down. For them, [Being Good Sucks][dV0aRfOr]. But rather than giving up on their goals, they choose to fight not because they believe they will truly make a difference, but because it's the right thing to do.

More often than not these characters are in settings that feature [Black and Gray Morality][BZ8YPyYo]. They're usually [survivors][F1JC6UKc] who have largely given up on believing in [Honor Before Reason][zftkt4Cy], but still strive to be [Lawful Good][f5mIyKpa] or as close to it as reality allows them to be. They are willing to bend the rules to save them. In [Lighter and Softer][S2sd1dfx] settings, these characters are [Grumpy Bears][a5wv40EX] and are often mocked by the other characters for being so sour all the time.

The presence of cynicism usually makes the [idealistic behavior even more noteworthy][hbNCMm5g]: it's easy to [love everyone][5RC1DOhN] when [Rousseau Was Right][m4QP5DTD], but you really have to be a good guy to believe that [Humans Are Bastards][X2OujTPk] and care about them anyway. Such characters can also be [The Fettered][oB6Qv0O1]; their cynical outlook tells them they could probably get away with all kinds of things that they don't do because [that would be wrong][YiWekhmg], and just because the world sucks doesn't mean you need to make it worse. Then again, this kind of character goes great with a world where you [Earn Your Happy Ending][g7geU5za] after much strife.

This is the inverse of the worldview of most [Well Intentioned Extremists][uNobssij], especially those who believe that [Utopia Justifies the Means][ZlNsbTKF]. Extremists or [Knight Templars][LBLA1LAs] may *believe* themselves to be this, but their actions are far too extreme. A Knight In Sour Armor believes in the rules and breaks them only when absolutely necessary, which is very rarely; not surprisingly, many have taken a [Heroic Vow][zKfqKOhU] related to this behavior. Often has a personal set of rules, trimmed down to those that really *matter* in order to minimize conflicts and distractions. Contributes to the Knight's gruff tendencies, since politeness tends to appear a lot further down the priority list than feeding orphans and so on.

Generally, these characters fit one of two personality types. Members of the first type are former [Wide Eyed Idealists][8qlXdrXV] who have come to [accept][oqMjL1xW] that their world is on the low end of the [Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism][vUa4vRV3], but who [still find something beautiful in their former ideals][hbNCMm5g] that they want to hold on to. Those of the second type are born cynics, who would make natural [Jerkass][2divM9bt] [antiheroes][vxmPUXur], but who nevertheless have devoted themselves to a code of honor or fair play. In either case, these people tend to have gone through (often painful) [Character Development][K894pePb] in their past, meaning that they are normally older than the average hero.

Either way, however, the effect is basically the same: you have a [Knight in Shining Armor][WIcvpSWM] wearing [Jade-Colored Glasses][oqMjL1xW]; the difference between the first and second types is which comes first.

These characters show up often in [Film Noir][fXmH1ST4], [Dark Fantasy][TnijeCWW], and [Low Fantasy][0sYzfdfX]. Law enforcement is a particularly attractive career, but the Knight in Sour Armor will usually hold back from becoming a [Cowboy Cop][nx27V3sG]. Very frequently, they end up as [The Mentor][lLEUEl8N], a [Grumpy Bear][a5wv40EX] with [Jade-Colored Glasses][oqMjL1xW], [The Last DJ][sYp83NmF], or a [Cool Old Guy][HQBcDNzo] if they last long enough. As teammates, they are often the [Sour Supporter][claGLKPs]. They also frequently end up as [Hero Antagonists][IHFoMqvc] and extreme [Woobies][qYnrrcMR]. This is often the final state of [The Atoner][Nq5flFlZ] post-[Heel–Face Turn][4B6daVlk]. Despite their cynicism, they behave like [The Anti-Nihilist][9n5Fx4uu].

Will often overlap with [The Snark Knight][UzouGqDL]. Compare [Angst? What Angst?][jsb8QcVT], for characters who take the [troubles of a good alignment][dV0aRfOr] with far less complaint; [Noble Demon][Rir5C6LI], who will [proudly declare themselves evil][pCoZZ6GI], but still finds themselves doing good once in a while; [Sour Outside, Sad Inside][KASXPX9J], for characters who sour attitude hides the fact they're sad; and [Jerkass Woobie][ZpecAgEQ], who spits in the face of the [alignment][IqutvgvQ] chart. Converted [Silly Rabbit, Idealism Is for Kids!][ViqwaLip] or [Good Is Old-Fashioned][q4RZfAog] believers may well find themselves becoming this trope if the heroes can bring them around. If they don't like idealism, but don't like cynicism, either, then you also have a touch of [Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers!][nBuyD2KU]

#### Knight in Sour Armor / Playing With

**Basic Trope**: A cynical character who is nevertheless [obstinately good][HAdZYHjX].

- **Straight**: Alice [Lime][h2Gj56UI] is an experienced police detective who honestly expects most of her cases to end [in tragedy][y1AhbVbG]... [but not for lack of trying][hM1P6s0q].
- **Exaggerated**: Alice is an [Iron Woobie][eVXthZl3] who is constantly undermined by those around her.
- **Justified**:
    - As a cop Alice has witnessed [Police Brutality][iV7lWYSa] and racial profiling, dealt with scumbag murderers and rapists, and on top that people hate her and assume she's a [Corrupt Cop][Y4WzIwXu] just because she's a cop.
    - Alice might think she lives in a [Crapsack World][HgZAHQwy], but also thinks that being [Good Feels Good][9Wyhkh7Q] even though it might [suck][dV0aRfOr] from time to time.
    - Alice might be cynical and think things will turn out for the worst, but she knows that there's still a chance that she's wrong and something good might happen.
    - Alice isn't fond of the state of the world, but that's all the more reason not to take it lying down, even if nobody else gives a shit.
- **Inverted**: Alice is an up-and-running villain filled with idealistic zeal of how easily she's going to [Take Over the World][2Y1WKwIb].
- **Double Subverted**:
    - ...and so is [everyone else][ePb4Qdur]. It's more suspicious if you *aren't*. Alice's bribes are voluntary payments from people grateful she actually did her job.
- **Zig Zagged**: The framing was actually a lie fabricated by Alice in order to hide her [True Colors][wVx1Urh1]. Which, in itself, was a lie to preserve her cover.
- **Averted**:
    - Alice is heroic, cheerful and optimistic.
    - Alice is cynical and doesn't bother to fight on.
- **Lampshaded**: "Why do you fight so hard if you know you're just going to lose?" "Things are bad enough already. I'm not letting them get worse."
- **Exploited**: Alice is assigned the case because the criminals are more likely to [mistake her for someone who can be bribed][JqmDP8vu].
- **Defied**: Whenever depression threatens, Alice remembers all the cases she closed successfully.
- **Discussed**: "Let me tell you right now — I would rather have Det. Lime investigating my murder than any wet-behind-the-ears [Wide-Eyed Idealist][8qlXdrXV] who thinks every criminal is always caught."
- **Conversed**: "You know, for a character as cynical as Det. Lime, she seems to be awfully heroic."
- **Deconstructed**:
    - Alternatively, she continues to protect a [Crapsack World][HgZAHQwy], not because it's the right thing to do, but because she's a [Blood Knight][okZ0VNnE] who thrives on conflict.
    - Alice's cynicism drives more idealistic folk away from her due to being [excessively bitter][oqMjL1xW] whilst other cynics scorn her for futilely trying to help people.
- **Reconstructed**: While she enjoys the warm fuzzies from fighting the good fight, she still goes into every case without expectations.
- **Played For Drama**: Alice gets her ideas thrown back in her face by a [Knight Templar][LBLA1LAs] or [Fallen Hero][mtmzpmft] who shares the same cynical beliefs as she does, forcing her to confront her own ideas and see how her attitude could create the same problems she despises.
- **Implied**: Alice goes into a rant about how the world is a [Crapsack World][HgZAHQwy]. When someone asks her why she fights, Alice gives them a meaningful look, but we don't see what she said.

The [Knight In Sour Armor][c2tY4vKt] is over here, ya goof... why do I even bother sometimes (mutter mutter)...

&gt; Sometimes cynicism is the last refuge of the idealist.
&gt; — LE Modesitt Jr, The Ethos Effect

&gt; Fighting for the little guy is for suckers. We all do it once in a while, but the trick is to get in and out quickly without getting involved. That's one trick I never really mastered.
&gt; —Michael, Burn Notice ("Pilot")

&gt; &gt; —Auron, Final Fantasy X

&gt; Taylor: Everything I’ve said in the past stands. Humans are idiots. They’re selfish and injust and unfair, they’re violent and clumsy and petty and shortsighted. Don’t get me wrong. Every part of that applies to me, too. I’m not setting myself above them on any level. But at the end of the day, sometimes humanity isn’t so bad.
&gt; Lisa: Sometimes. Took me a while to realize that. The more you find out, the uglier things tend to look. But you keep looking, and it’s not all bad at the end.
&gt; — Worm

&gt; Woman in alley: Thank you! Thank you! That thing was going to kill me!

&gt; Jon Snow: I don't know how to do that. I thought I did...but I failed.
&gt; Davos Seaworth: Good. Now go fail again.
&gt; — Game of Thrones, "Oathbreaker"

Your wife can't remember your last name. Your kids don't want to talk to you. You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself. Trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.
&gt; Matt Farrell: Then why you doing this?
&gt; John McClane: Because there's nobody else to do it right now, that's why. Believe me, if there were somebody else to do it, I'd let them do it, but there's not. So we're doing it.
&gt; —Live Free or Die Hard

&gt; Liara: So tell me, Shepard, what are you fighting for?
&gt; Shepard: I guess I'm fighting for us. All of us.

&gt; Shepard: People are messy, awkward, sometimes selfish and cruel. But they're trying, and I'm going to make sure they have a chance.
&gt; —Mass Effect 2

&gt; I'm no hero. Never was, never will be. Just an old killer, hired to do some wet-work.
&gt; — Solid Snake, Metal Gear Solid

&gt; Do not be deceived, Wormwood. [Satan's] cause is never more in danger, than when a human, no longer desiring, but intending, to do our Enemy [God]'s will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.
&gt; — The Demon Screwtape, The Screwtape Letters

&gt; The future is an inherently good thing. And we move into it one winter at a time. Things get better one winter at a time. If you're going to celebrate anything, then have a drink on this: The world is, generally and on balance, a better place to live this year than it was last year.
&gt; — Spider Jerusalem, Transmetropolitan

&gt; Hey! Mother Theresa! I was gonna do it anyway. I just hate being lectured.
&gt; — Gene Ryack, Air America

&gt; Marston: Escuella was always a torn man. A cynic who desperately wanted to be a romantic.
&gt; Abraham: Whereas you, John, are a romantic who wants to be a cynic.
&gt; — Red Dead Redemption

&gt; Arthur: I did build a stronghold. Kaamelott, they call it. I sought and hired knights in the whole kingdom; in Caledonia, in Carmelid, in Gaunes, in Vannes, in Wales; I ordered a big table, to have the knights sitting together; I ordered it round, to prevent having a knight sitting in a corner, or at the end of it; it was complicated, so I tried to explain what was the Grail, to make sure everyone understand; it was hard, so I tried to laugh, to make sure nobody got bored; I failed; but I don't want anyone to say that I did nothing. Because it's not true.
&gt; — Kaamelott

&gt; Renate: A Knight in Shining Armor did nothing for nobody. He never fought. A knight in dented, scraped armor, now that's what you want.
&gt; — Nancy Drew: The Haunting of Castle Malloy

&gt; Nicodemus: Such as why you chose this kind of life for yourself. To appoint yourself protector of mortal kind, and to make yourself the enemy of any who would do them harm. To live outcast from your own kind, laughed at and mocked by most mortals. Living in a hovel, barely scraping by. Spurning wealth and fame. Why do you do it?
&gt; Harry Dresden: I'm a disciple of the Tao of Peter Parker, obviously.
&gt; — The Dresden Files: Death Masks

&gt; Tough cop, whore from the slums, true love&gt; —love that overcomes a powerful curse. A fairy tale... In a world dominated by scorn and meanness, a world full of bandits and murderers, true love can &gt; still work wonders. Lost causes are worth the struggle. A fairy tale...
&gt; — Geralt, The Witcher

&gt; A sword is a weapon. The art of swordsmanship is learning how to kill. That is the truth. What Miss Kaoru says is sweet and innocent talk that only those whose hands have never been stained with the blood of men can believe. But to tell you the truth, I much prefer Miss Kaoru's sweet and innocent talk over the truth, that I do.
&gt; — Himura Kenshin, Rurouni Kenshin

&gt; Word of advice, Ressler. This work we perform, it does not serve to look backward. This city (London), wickedness will ever leave its spores here. You and I, we are not magicians. We cannot see through walls or into men's minds. Dozens perished but hundreds who were ill are now well once more. We fight. Well fight with all the skills we may muster. Beyond that, we may do no more.
&gt; — Edmund Reid, Ripper Street

&gt; "Stop that," he says. "That pseudo-mysterious omnipotent voice might trick the soccer moms at the local Renaissance fair, but due to my inherent cynicism it's going to take a hell of a show to convince me."
&gt; "Oh, no," she says. "You, Mr. Vantas, are a fake cynic, the worst and most tragic kind."
&gt; — The fic look up, look up

&gt; "Hey! I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out. You and me, once and for all. "Winning?" Is that what you think it’s about? I'm not trying to win. I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone. It's not because it's fun. God knows it's not because it's easy. It's not even because it works because it hardly ever does. I do what I do because it's right! Because it's decent! And above all, it's kind! It's just that... Just kind. If I run away today, good people will die. If I stand and fight, some of them might live. Maybe not many, maybe not for long. Hey, you know, maybe there's no point to any of this at all. But it's the best I can do. So I'm going to do it. And I'm going to stand here doing it until it kills me. And you're going to die too! Some day... And how will that be? Have you thought about it? What would you die for? Who I am is where I stand. Where I stand is where I fall. Stand with me. These people are terrified. Maybe we can help a little. Why not, just at the end, just be kind?"
&gt; — The Twelfth Doctor, "The Doctor Falls"

&gt; "I don't know any of you. But that doesn't matter, does it? My family: the family you demonized and excommunicated, has fought and died through generations for this country. We do this thing... for Wallachia, and her people. We don't have to know you all. We do it anyway. And it's not the dying that frightens us; it's never having stood up and fought for you. I'm Trevor Belmont. Of the House of Belmont. And dying... has never frightened me."
&gt; —Trevor Belmont, Castlevania (2017)

&gt; "And yeah, it's a shit, shit world, but you know what? Good things are done every day. Just not, apparently, by you."
&gt; — Maddie Bowen, Blood Diamond

&gt; "If I let everyone I thought was an idiot die, then there wouldn't be very many people left, would there?"
&gt; — Gilgamesh Wulfenbach, Girl Genius

&gt; Harry: "Morgan, what the hell are you doing?"
&gt; Morgan: "My duty. I've always known that it might call for me to give up my life to protect the Council. And so it has."
&gt; Harry: "Morgan..."
&gt; Morgan: "You did your best. Despite everything that has gone between us. You put yourself to the hazard again and again for my sake. It was a worthy effort. But it just wasn't to be. No shame in that. You'll learn, if you live long enough. You never win them all."
&gt; See, here's the thing. Morgan was right: you can't win them all. But that doesn't mean you give up. Not ever. Morgan never said that part - he was too busy living it.
&gt; — The Dresden Files, Turn Coat

&gt; Judy Hopps: I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it.
&gt; Chief Bogo: Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps. The world has always been broken. That's why we need good cops... like you.
&gt; —Zootopia

            <Text>#### Mississippi

Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Mississippi was established as a Crown colony encompassing the unsettled region south of the Ohio river down to the Gulf of Mexico, West of the Mississippi and East of the Continental Divide. Essentially, this is the south-of-Ohio Mississippi watershed.

Mississippi will later include the modern-day cities of (TN) Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Clarksville, Murfreesboro, (MS) Jackson, (AL) Huntsville, (KY) Louisville, and Lexington.
Atlanta &amp; Tallahassee are on the Georgia side of the Mississippi-Georgia border.

Mississippi developed slower than Charlotina due to a less benign climate and native population, until similar temples were discovered in its hinterlands. 
A strong military tradition started in Mississippi after the British government gave land grants to officer and enlisted veterans of the Seven Year's War. Similar grants were given in subsequent wars.

**Boundaries.**
The Mississippi-Pennsylvania border follows the Monongahela River from Pittsburgh until it hits the Pennsylvania-Virginia border line (West Virginia, IRL) just south of Point Marion.
The Mississippi-Virginia border follows the Mason-Dixon line East from where the Mississippi-Pennsylvania line intersect it until it intersects the Northern Branch Potomac River, north of Cumberland, VA. From there it follows the IRL boundary between Maryland and Virginia until reaches the Potomac head waters at 39°14′15″N 79°29′8″W.
The Mississippi-Carolina border...
The boundary with Georgia &amp; Carolina is separated by the Chattahoochee River with Mississippi encompassing all land West until the Chattahoochee head water, then the shortest-route to Carolina.[^OTL-Mississippi-boundaries]

## Series Plot / Outline

_**a one-page (4-5 paragraph) summary of the world, major characters and central tension.**_

&lt;!-- Write an overview of the series idea, describing the world or setting it takes place in, the unique conflicts faced, and the dynamics between main characters that fuel the story. This is a great sales tool because you're going to highlight the most interesting facets and themes of the series. You should be able to do this in three paragraphs, but a few pages is ok so long as the writing is "tight" and reads efficiently, moving the story beat by beat. --&gt;

In the 18th century, humanity discovered advanced alien technology in the Toltec Indian mounds. Over the next 150 years, society embraces the technology and develops interstellar travel via the slipstream, all while retaining paranoid nationalism. When they encounter other human settlements on alien worlds, they chose to study them out of concern that "alien" use of slipstream technology puts them at risk.

Albert Strand is a descendent of the original discoverer of the Indian mounds and lives under that shadow. Putting career before family, he lobbied hard to be assigned to the Orbital.

&lt;!-- Looking at PoI's formatting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_Interest_(TV_series) --&gt;
a 1-2 page that gives an overview of the characters, major series arcs.

1. Paragraph introduces the main character and the central series plot.
2. Paragraph explains the major characters &amp; relationships to main character and one-another.
3. Paragraph summarizes major series sub-plots, one sentence per subplot. Highlight on the first major subplot to address.
4. Paragraph of season two summary in four sentences: the core season conflict, new characters/conflicts. Service the subplots.
5. Ditto each new season. Close each subplot introduced in the sub-plot paragraph. Introduce a new one as necessary.

            <Title>Concept &amp; Theme</Title>
            <Text>Strand is a low fantasy, Type-X alternative-history series written by Ben Wilson.
In the 18th Century, British-Americans uncover an ancient acropolis that introduces (advanced, ancient human) lost technology in the Ohio Territory at the end of the Seven Years’ War. This leads to America remaining in the UK despite continued struggle by the Sons of Liberty. Britain becomes a low culture, high tech society. We have a faction (SOL) who want to divide, and a faction (Tory) who want to unite; both want to control the strange tech, but ultimately come together to keep it from the French &amp; Indians.
Throughout the 19th Century, a secret British society reverse-engineers the Neutrinovoltaic power. This increases degrees of separation between Britain and the rest of the world, creating a decade dissonance. A technological espionage struggle ensues among the great powers. The Napoleonic &amp; Crimean wars occur per OTL, but with different outcomes. British North America starts its Western expansion, leading to the Mexican war, which becomes British.
By the 20th Century, technological equilibrium is established with Britain replicating its IRL trade dominance benefiting Europe. The UK re-invents slipstream travel, with Albert Strand ultimately strand on Elysion and trying to get home. Belize becomes the launch region for space travel.
In Strand Series, we explore the perennial struggle of a society when its technological capabilities out-strips its morality. Most Americans do not understand the technology they use. Nor are they interested in its long-term implications. We also explore the tension between centralism/de-centralism, individualism, etc. As religion was a significant part of society, Christianity will be explored in a manner non-threatening to the reader.
We also explain how American remaining a part of Great Britain would not have hindered our global dominance. But, what about the Bill of Rights &amp; Constitution?</Text>

            <Text>##### Society for Alien/American/Advanced Research (SAR)

**Overview.** Originally called the Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research Efforts (ST3R), the Society for Alien Research (SAR) is a limited crown company charged with deciphering Toltec technology into viable capabilities that keeps Britain globally dominant.

**Naming Confusion.** The original name owes to a misunderstanding of archeology, which was subsequently renamed in various times as either the Society for Alien (or) American (or) Advanced Research.

**The Babylonian Captivity.** ST3R operated on the grounds of Franklin's Public Academy of Philadelphia. Its move from Philadelphia to Yale under Kneass' directorship, a period known as the Babylonian Captivity by College of Philadelphia members. It returned to Philadelphia after Kneass' death in 1840 and remained since.

#### Timeline

&lt;!-- * 1782 November 30 - American surveyor Ephraim George Biggs discovered Toltec temple under the Arkansan Toltec Mounds. Within the mounds is a trove of technology and modern-era weaponry, including an advanced, operating computer storing alien technology. The computer and all technology was transported to Philadelphia, which is the center of American social &amp; political life.
* 1784 April 9 - The Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research (ST3R) was chartered by King George III to decipher the technology. The Fifth French War increased the zeal of the research, with the major breakthrough occurring in 1814 discovering that the computer was a patent library exposing centuries of advanced technology.
* 1807 - Computer re-energized using what were later identified as solar panels
* 1812 - Language reverse engineered, technology deemed "Alien" instead of "Toltec," though some posit that the Toltecs are descended from Aliens.
* 1814 - ST3R realizes computer stores alien patents
* 1825 - Yale establishes the "Society for Alien Research" (SAR)
* 1826-40 - ST3R moved from Philadelphia, New Haven, Connecticut (Yale)
* 1840 - SAR returned to Salomon’s House, Philadelphia --&gt;

            <Text>War Debt Equity Act of 1772
In the quid pro quo for the Rights of Religious Liberty Act, British North America provinces agreed to take on half of the Government’s debt incurred by the end of the French &amp; Indian War. Whether this meant war debt or total debt was a matter of disagreement that was settled during the Napoleonic Era. The Seven Years’ War nearly doubled Great Britain’s national debt, so the question of whether British North America provinces accepted a quarter or half of the debt was no small issue. Buried in this act was the liquidation of various debts by prominent members of British North America society. This pushed the Sons of Liberty into the fringe by bribing the elite.
