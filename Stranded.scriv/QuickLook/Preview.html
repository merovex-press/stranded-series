Access to advanced technology early set the British on a path to global dominance unabated in the 20th Century.</span></p></p>

Americans viewed Locke’s Second Treatise of Government as a blueprint for social change. The British viewed it as wasted paper. Benign neglect from the 1720s to 1740s resulted in colonists assuming more control for their affairs; home rule de jure. This neglect was shattered during the Seven Year’s War, but Ame...</p>
