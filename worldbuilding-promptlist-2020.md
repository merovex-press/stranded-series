## BONUS: YOUR ELEVATOR PITCH

An elevator pitch is a 3-6 sentence description that conveys the interesting relevant ideas on a topic that can be said in 30-60 seconds. Why bother with this? It’s commonly said that within 7 seconds a person has formed first impressions. Explaining an idea to someone requires grabbing their interest quickly, and without confusing them, or risk losing it. Try writing an elevator pitch for your world, then test it out on somebody!
