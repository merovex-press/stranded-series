# The Story Equation

##### Driving the Internal Plot

1.  **The Lie Believed.** ...
2.  **Surprise 1 - Lie Proved.** ...
3.  **Reaction 1 - Quest Committed.** ...
4.  **The Truth Voiced.** ...
5.  **Surprise 2 - Lie Doubted.** ...
6.  **Surprise 3 - Lie Confronted.** ...
7.  **Epiphany - Truth Embraced.** ...

## The Greatest Fear

You’ll use to build the Black Moment Event in Act 3. You’ll also use it to build your character Flaw. This will help you figure out his behavior at the beginning and his New Man change at the end, culminating in that thing he can do at the end that he can’t at the beginning, usually a Sacrifice or Grand Gesture, and often shown during the Final Battle.

### The Lie

this sets up his inner journey. You’ll use the Lie to form the final Epiphany (Truth) as well as truthlets dropped by secondary characters or derived from action in the story. The Lie also molds his motivations and choices from the onset of the story. The power of the Lie is realized during the Black Moment Effect to set up the Epiphany and cause inner Character Change.

### The Wound

the emotional repercussion of the DMS. This Wound is used in the formation of the Happily Ever After (HEA) ending, as well as used in a romance to create the Breakup. The Wound also causes healing between characters.

### The Secret Desire

used to create the inner motivation for the Noble Quest. Awakened by the Inciting Incident, the Secret Desire is something birthed after the DMS and nested deep inside the hero. It is the primary motivation behind his Noble Quest. Add to these primary elements:

### Competing Values

two powerful values, birthed from his DMS, which compete to push the character forward, especially during the Great Debate. In Act 2, these values will propel him forward in turns until the Black Moment Event when he usually must choose between one or the other to complete the story (and thus contribute to the Black Moment Effect).

### Want

the motivation behind the external goal, a clearer, articulated driving force that propels the character forward from the first scene. The Want is transformed by the Inciting Incident and the Invitation to the Noble Quest into an external, Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely (SMART) goal. Once external goals are established, obstacles can be brainstormed to discover the external conflict.

### Why

the simple motivation behind his actions, the culmination of the DMS in an easy explanation. This motivation keeps you, as the author, centered on why he’s taking this journey.

### Happiest Moment

although this is not part of the DMS, this helps build the Greatest Dream and sets up the perfect HEA ending. Similar to the DMS, it should be relatable, specific, poignant.

You find this Happily Ever After ending by doing two things:

* Determine the Wound. What would heal this? Determine the Greatest Dream.
* What part of this can you, as the author, give him?

A great book leaves the character and the reader both healed and delighted. Give them an ending they can’t forget.
