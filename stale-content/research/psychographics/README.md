# Psychographics

It’s a way of studying population groups according to their attitudes, aspirations, values, habits, hobbies, spending habits, opinions, fears, lifestyles, and other psychological criteria. It’s a way of trying to do more than simply identify a customer. It’s a means of understanding them. Put succinctly, the old metric, demographics, explained who the customer is, while the new metric, psychographics, explains why they prefer a particular kind of product.

> Start looking at what emotional tropes are being served, rather than what the readership might look like.

You can start to define your USP (or what makes your book unique) by answering the following questions:

1. What makes your book different from any other book out there?
1. What makes your book unique in its genre(s)?
1. What kind of person would be interested in reading the book you have created?
1. Does this book fulfill a particular desire or wish from its audience? Is it useful in a way that no other books are? How?
1. Does your book take advantage of a trend in the genre or in culture? If so, what?
1. What is the strongest benefit a reader can have from buying your book? How will it change their lives or entertain them in a way that nothing else can?

Who do I think my MVP audience is? How do I confirm?

1. They do a lot of traveling, either for business or on the road.
   1. If for business, then they are
2. they prefer audible or kindle
3. they have conservative / christian values

Use Likert (1-5) and use NPS equation.

What I want to know:

* Where do they consume (on the road, at home)
* Do they want short-form or long-form fiction
* They prefer a series (list a few of the top series that you think work)
* Why do they read (to think, escape)
* What genre do they prefer? (use the series?)
* Themes they like
* OCEAN? Why would I care?

## Audience psychographics
Psychographics refer to all the psychological variables that combine to form a person’s inner self. Even if two people share the same demographic or geographic characteristics, they may still hold entirely different ideas and values that define them personally and socially. Some of these differences are explained by looking at the psychographic characteristics that define them.  Psychographic variables include:

**Motives** – an internal force that stimulates someone to behave in a particular manner. A person has media consumption motives and buying motives. A motive for watching television may be to escape; a motive for choosing to watch a situation comedy rather than a police drama may be the audience member’s need to laugh rather than feel suspense and anxiety.

**Attitudes** – a learned predisposition, a feeling held toward an object, person, or idea that leads to a particular behaviour. Attitudes are enduring; they are positive or negative, affecting likes and dislikes. A strong positive attitude can make someone very loyal to a brand (one person is committed to the Mazda brand so they will only consider Mazda models when it is time to buy a new car). A strong negative attitude can turn an audience member away from a message or product (someone disagrees with the political slant of Fox News and decides to watch MSNBC instead).

**Personalities** – a collection of traits that make a person distinctive. Personalities influence how people look at the world, how they perceive and interpret what is happening around them, how they respond intellectually and emotionally, and how they form opinions and attitudes.

**Lifestyles** – these factors form the mainstay of psychographic research. Lifestyle research studies the way people allocate time, energy and money.

### Examples

She was crazy.

> Debbie is a 45–54 year old married woman living in the suburbs whose children still live at home, or recently moved out. She’s college educated and works full-time, and she loves traveling and laying on the beach with a good book. She’s a loyal contemporary romance reader, and reads at least one book a week. Her favorite authors are Nora Roberts and Jude Deveraux, and her favorite movies are Titanic and The Notebook. When she’s not reading romance, she peruses People and US Weekly, and is subscribed to the blog Smart Bitches Trashy Books. She spends most of her time online on Facebook and dabbles with Pinterest. She also does most of her book shopping online. She’ll grab a good deal when she sees it, but if she loves an author’s work or series — or is tempted by what’s trending — she’ll buy a book at full price.
