Ephraim and Mortimer talk about the rifle, and Mortimer tries to get him drunk, only to learn that Ephraim has a high alcohol tolerance. They argue about British authority instead. "Your sentence will be carried out." "I've not been tried yet." "You were in absentia."
Meanwhile, Kariwase involved in another attack somewhere, and we find that he is up-and-coming and very anti-European.
