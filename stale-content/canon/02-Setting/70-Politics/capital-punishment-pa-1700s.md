> Quakers forced themselves to accept the death penalty and advised their members on the path to avoid such a fate, prominent Quakers remained reluctant to execute except in unique cases. Both Anglicans and Quakers served on the colony‘s Supreme Court, but all four chief justices in this period (David Lloyd, Jeremiah Langhorne, James Logan, and John Kinsey) were Quakers. Despite their periodic issues with Yearly Meeting, these men struggled to mediate traditional Quaker opposition to the death penalty with the calls by many Anglicans for harsh punishments.

> Rather than serve only as a form of social control, their public deaths allowed colonial leaders, including their Quaker supporters, to preserve this fragile peace on the frontier.

> The execution of the Winters also revealed the Quaker-dominated Assembly‘s belief that only the colonial government possessed the authority to decide who died on the gallows despite their reluctance to use capital punishment. Not the Indians nor British.

> Local elites in Philadelphia began to develop the intellectual and cultural life of the colony with the establishment of the American Philosophical Society, Library Company, College
