### Body Armor

* [Stab Resistance of Personal Body Armor, NIJ Standard-0115.00 | National Institute of Justice](https://nij.ojp.gov/library/publications/stab-resistance-personal-body-armor-nij-standard-011500)

Table: Comparison of the Properties of Natural Spider Silk, Kevlar® and Steel

|             | **Material Toughness** | **Tensile Strength** | **Weight** |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Dragon Silk | 120,000-160,000        | 1,100-2,900          | 1.36       |
| Kevlar®     | 30,000-50,000          | 2,600-4,100          | 1.44       |
| Steel       | 2,000-6,000            | 300-2,000            | 7.84       |

* **Material Toughness.** Measured by the energy required to break a continuous filament, expressed in joules per kilogram (J/kg). A .357 caliber bullet has approximately 925 joules of kinetic energy at impact. A .308 caliber bullet has approximately 2,700 joules of kinetic energy at impact.

* **Tensile Strength.** Tensile strength refers to the greatest longitudinal stress the spider silk can bear, measured by force over area in units of newtons per square meter. The measurement here is in millions of pascals.

* **Weight.** In grams per cubic centimeter of material.

**Toughness v. Other Weapons.** Comparing Kevlar / Dragon Silk against 18th Century Weapons, namely Arrows and .80 caliber lead shot.

* [Brown Bess musket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bess) has about 3,800 joules of kinetic energy. A [Civil War v. Kevlar video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xi35DqbchA&ab_channel=PaperCartridges) shows the bullet will not penetrate, but blunt force trauma may be a concern. 

* An [Arrows & Body armor video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y08hwbz574I&ab_channel=DonutOperator) shows that a 70# pull bow will pierce NIJ IIIa soft protection (with either field or broadhead arrow), but not NIJ III hard protection, without blunt force trauma as the [arrow lacks sufficient kinetic energy](https://www.forbes5.pitt.edu/article/production-muskets-and-their-effects-eighteenth-century)

#### Behind Armor Blunt Trauma (BABT)

BABT is the non-penetrating injury resulting from the rapid deformation of armors covering the body. Called **mushrooming**. Injuries will be rib fracture, hematoma in the lung, heart.

* 50% of pigs died with 40mm, vice 25% at 34mm, 0% at 28mm.

* takes about 5 minutes to recover after being shot...low blood pressure and low O<sub>2</sub> levels

* Beneath the body armor point of impact, an almost circular skin lesion consisting of cutaneous abrasions with subcutaneous hematomas were evident in all exposed animals. A rib fracture was found beneath the skin lesion in some animals, but no hemothorax or pneumothorax was observed. All exposed animals exhibited a hematoma in the right lung underlying the impact area; some showed smaller areas of emphysema.

* Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, 26% of cases.

* Cardiac contusion, 54% of cases, 29% ruptures.

* 8 layers of Kevlar sufficient to dissipate 82% of kinetic energy. http://www.mayfieldha.com/_Media/smayfield_kevlartrauma.pdf

**Source for physical characteristics.** 

* Premier's III hard protection is 10x12" weighing 2.5# per plate. Call it 7# for the vest. 

* Premier's IIIa soft vest is .22" of Kevlar. Dragon silk is 3.5x stronger, so 0.06" thick is equivalent.  A [flannel shirt is 0.015"](https://propercloth.com/reference/fabric-thickness-weight/). Therefore a comparable dragon silk vest is 4 times thicker than a flannel shirt, or more like a heavy denim jacket.
