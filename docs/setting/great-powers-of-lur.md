## Eutanio Empire

Eutanio (England) avoids aggression due to its efforts to consolidate its global empire and make sense of the technology. This is the most merchantile and privatized society. They retained the 13 colonies by embracing equal representation.

## Herritar

Herritar (Ottoman)

## Mofricka

Mofricka (France) is an ancient rival to Eutanio. When news emerged of Eutanio's discoveries in an ancient temple, they commissioned a government exploration of similar temples. They waged war against Herritar after confirming the existence of alien tech, grabbing the necessary territory before Eutanio forced an end to the war by threatening naval blockade. Mofrika is a republic (after a fashion).

## Sakumani Empire

Sakumani (Germany) is more aggressive as it is the newest power that is geographically vulnerable to two of its ancient enemies (Tedesko and Mofricka). They have an effective spy network that helped them get accelerate their alien-technology growth by stealing technology from other empires.

## Tedesko

Tedesko (Russia)
