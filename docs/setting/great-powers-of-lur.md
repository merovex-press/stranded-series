## Eutanio Empire

Eutanio (England) avoids aggression due to its efforts to consolidate its global empire and make sense of the technology discovered in new world Khēmi (Aztec) temples. This is the most mercantile and privatized society. They retained the 13 colonies by embracing equal representation.

## Herritar

Herritar (Ottoman) was the traditional boogeyman of Haseria, but emerged from the Imperial Struggles a shell of its former self. On the decline, the other powers vacillate between shoring up its power and exploiting its weakness, depending on their strategic needs. Mofrika seized its temples soon after confirming there was alien tech within. This leads to most referring to Herritar as the Sick Old Man of Eutanio. A toothless power kept alive only because of rivalry.

## Mofricka

Mofricka (France) is an ancient rival to Eutanio. When news emerged of Eutanio's discoveries in an ancient temple, they commissioned a government exploration of similar (Vaŝinĉik, egypt) temples. They waged war against Herritar after confirming the existence of alien tech, grabbing the necessary territory before Eutanio forced an end to the war by threatening naval blockade. Mofrika is a republic (after a fashion).

## Sakumani Empire

Sakumani (Germany) is more aggressive as it is the newest power that is geographically vulnerable to two of its ancient enemies (Tedesko and Mofricka). They have an effective spy network that helped them get accelerate their alien-technology growth by stealing technology from other empires. They call the Imperial Struggles the Haserian Khampo.

## Tedesko

Tedesko (Russia) is a great power with vast untapped resources. It is viewed rather exotically. It held its own during the Imperial Struggles due to its expanse and large population. It is not directly involved in the Slipstream arms race as the Struggles led to internal conflict bordering on civil war and a stalled economic engine.
