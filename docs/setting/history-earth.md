# History

## Point of Divergence

* 1756-1763 - Seven Years War occurs as the 4th intercolonial war between England/France.
* 1765-1771 - Strain between American colonies and heavily indebted Britain led to a new Parliament that incorporated representation of American colonies. This prevents the American Revolutionary War.
  - 1765-66 - Stamp Act passed and repealed.
  - 1766 - Parliament invites a delegation of American colonies to work out differences. **_The [Declaratory Act of 1766](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaratory_Act) never occurs._**
  - 1767-69 - A series of conversations were had between Parliament and colonial legislatures.
  - 1769 - Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769 extended to continental colonial Englishmen.
  - 1771 - Reform in America Act of 1771 transforms the continental colonies to six provinces: Canada, New England, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Carolina, Georgia. Each province given limited representation in British Parliament.
  - 1772 - Rights of Religious Liberty Act of 1772 permits provinces to manage their own religious affairs. In exchange, the American provinces cooperated with levying taxes that paid down British debt.
* 1783-1815 - French economy collapses due to Seven Year's War debt and speculation and takes the government with it. The French Revolution is a decade early, ends the same but with American participation in Europe.
* 1802-1815 - War between France and most of Europe. Ended by British & American deployment of Toltec weaponry
* 1783-1833 - Anglo-American anti-slavery movement ends slave trade
  - 1807 during a break in the French Troubles
  - 1833 ends slavery in all British holdings by stages & "apprenticeships". Slave owners were compensated. American high-society slave owners were well-compensated, lower-class owners were not, leading to some animosity.
  - 1846-48 - Apprenticeships ended in American provinces (Virginia, Carolina, Georgia) to increase representation in Parliament, leading to local civil conflicts in each province by the lower class "masters," which was put down by General Scott.

## Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research Efforts (ST3R) / Society for Alien Research (SAR)

* 1799 - American archeologists discover Toltec temple inside the Arkansan Toltec Indian Mounds. Within the mounds is a trove of technology and modern-era weaponry, including an advanced, operating computer storing alien technology. The computer and all technology was transported to Philadelphia, which is the center of American social & political life.
* 1800 - The Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research (ST3R) was chartered by King George III to decipher the technology. The war increased the zeal of the research, with the major breakthrough occurring in 1814 discovering that the computer was a patent library exposing centuries of advanced technology.
  * Robert Fulton is ST3R's First Chairman until 1815
  * Simeon North, ST3R 2nd Chairman 1815-1826.
  * Samuel Morse joins in 1810 as apprentice after graduating Yale, ST3R Chairman 1826 after wife's death
  * Henry Blair joined ST3R in 1830
* 1807 - Computer re-energized using what were later identified as solar panels
* 1812 - Language reverse engineered, technology deemed "Alien" instead of "Toltec," though some posit that the Toltecs are descended from Aliens.
* 1814 - ST3R realizes computer stores alien patents
* 1825 - Yale establishes the "Society for Alien Research" (SAR)
* 1826-28 - ST3R moved from Philadelphia to New Haven, Connecticut (Yale)

## Weapons Development

### Personal Weapons

Several weapons were found in the Toltec Indian Mound Temple. Anglo-American first reverse-engineered the actual weapon as the first generation. A second iteration led to improvements

* 1803 - Pennsylvania Toltec Arms, Ltd. (PTA Ltd.) chartered by Jacob Dickert and Martin Meylin Jr. to reverse-engineer & produce Toltec weapons, moved by royal request to Harper's Ferry.
* 1807 first successful reverse-engineered prototype built
* 1814 - PTA Ltd. completed 4,000 rifles Harper's Ferry Model 1803, also known as the Toltec Battle Rifle Model '03 (HFM-03, TBRM-03 or BRM-03) essentially the StG-44. This is a straight reverse-engineer
* 1815 - Battle of Waterloo turned by use of the BRM-03
* 1815 - PTA Ltd. charter revoked. Crown forms "Harpers Ferry Arsenal" with the same leadership
* 1819 - The Model 1819 (M1819, AK-47) "Hall Rifle" replaces the BRM-03
* 1808-17 - Semi-automatic pistols reverse engineered and improved, essentially the boxy Glock is the improved result.

### Field Artillery

The cannon was quickly replaced by what we would consider modern field artillery.

* 1813 - Reverse engineer of Toltec field gun complete. Never entered mass production.
* 1818 - the Harper's Arsenal Ordinance (HAO) 5-inch howitzer fielded. Deemed to bulky to deploy in service
* 1829 - the [HAO Improved (HAOi) 4.5-inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QF_4.5-inch_howitzer) accepted by British military
* 1830 - HAOi 4.5-inch placed in service.

## Power (Engines, Electricity & Locomotion)

Engine development was slower as it derived from patent research. Dates below indicate when they were commercially available.

* Oil discovered - 1826, knock 20 years off of evolution of oil
* Diesel engine - 1828 (as biomass engine)
* Gasoline engine - 1836, limited use to highly urban environments due to poor infrastructure and lack of access to gas.
* Diesel locomotive - 1839 - Slow and mechanically inefficient
* Diesel-magneto / Diesel-electric - 1842
* Gasoline automobile - 1845, limited utility in favor of biomass trucks.
* Oil-burning naval ships - 1888
* Electricity - 1820 - using hydropower. Biomass generators commercially available by 1839

## Slipstream Technology

Slipstream technology describes the ability to get from Earth to Slipstream and through Slipstream
* Slipstream travel discovered in computer - 1828
* 1881 - Society for Slipsteam Research (SSR) established
* 1828-1870 - Building out the infrastructure
* 1870 - Earth to Orbit - Reusable spacecraft.
* 1876 - Orbit to Slipstream
* 1880 - First successful jump between Earth and another system
* 1880 - SSR Renamed Odyssey, Ltd.
* 1889 - Slipstreams all mapped out
* 1898 - Orbital in Migdal system started
* 1904 - Migdal Orbital operational
* 1907 - Migdal Orbital attacked
