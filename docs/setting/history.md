# History

## Break in Earth History

* 1756-1763 - Seven Years War occurs as the 4th intercolonial war between England/France.
* 1765-1773 - Strain between American colonies and heavily indebted Britain led to a new Parliament that incorporated representation of American colonies. This prevents the American Revolutionary War. A
* 1783-1815 - French economy collapses due to Seven Year's War debt and speculation and takes the government with it. The French Revolution is a decade early, ends the same but with American participation in Europe.
* 1802-1815 - War between France and most of Europe. Ended by British & American deployment of Toltec weaponry
* 1783-1833 - Anglo-American anti-slavery movement ends slave trade
  - 1807 during a break in the French Troubles
  - 1833 ends slavery in all British holdings by stages & "apprenticeships". Slave owners were compensated. American high-society slave owners were well-compensated, lower-class owners were not, leading to some animosity.
  - 1876 - Apprenticeships ended

## Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research Efforts (ST3R) / Society for Alien Research (SAR)

* 1799 - American archeologists discover Toltec temple inside the Arkansan Toltec Indian Mounds. Within the mounds is a trove of technology and modern-era weaponry, including an advanced, operating computer storing alien technology. The computer and all technology was transported to Philadelphia, which is the center of American social & political life.
* 1800 - The Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research (ST3R) was chartered by King George III to decipher the technology. The war increased the zeal of the research, with the major breakthrough occurring in 1814 discovering that the computer was a patent library exposing centuries of advanced technology.
  * Robert Fulton is ST3R's First Chairman until 1815
  * Simeon North, ST3R 2nd Chairman 1815-1826.
  * Samuel Morse joins in 1810 as apprentice after graduating Yale, ST3R Chairman 1826 after wife's death
  * Henry Blair joined ST3R in 1830
* 1807 - Computer re-energized using what were later identified as solar panels
* 1812 - Language reverse engineered, technology deemed "Alien" instead of "Toltec," though some posit that the Toltecs are descended from Aliens.
* 1814 - ST3R realizes computer stores alien patents
* 1825 - Yale establishes the "Society for Alien Research" (SAR)
* 1826-28 - ST3R moved from Philadelphia to New Haven, Connecticut (Yale)

## Weapons Development

### Personal Weapons

Several weapons were found in the Toltec Indian Mound Temple. Anglo-American first reverse-engineered the actual weapon as the first generation. A second iteration led to improvements

* 1803 - Pennsylvania Toltec Arms, Ltd. (PTA Ltd.) chartered by Jacob Dickert and Martin Meylin Jr. to reverse-engineer & produce Toltec weapons, moved by royal request to Harper's Ferry.
* 1807 first successful reverse-engineered prototype built
* 1814 - PTA Ltd. completed 4,000 rifles Harper's Ferry Model 1803, also known as the Toltec Battle Rifle Model '03 (HFM-03, TBRM-03 or BRM-03) essentially the StG-44. This is a straight reverse-engineer
* 1815 - Battle of Waterloo turned by use of the BRM-03
* 1815 - PTA Ltd. charter revoked. Crown forms "Harpers Ferry Arsenal" with the same leadership
* 1819 - The Model 1819 (M1819, AK-47) "Hall Rifle" replaces the BRM-03
* 1808-17 - Semi-automatic pistols reverse engineered and improved, essentially the boxy Glock is the improved result.

### Field Artillery

The cannon was quickly replaced by what we would consider modern field artillery.

* 1813 - Reverse engineer of Toltec field gun complete. Never entered mass production.
* 1818 - the Harper's Arsenal Ordinance (HAO) 5-inch howitzer fielded. Deemed to bulky to deploy in service
* 1829 - the [HAO Improved (HAOi) 4.5-inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QF_4.5-inch_howitzer) accepted by British military
* 1830 - HAOi 4.5-inch placed in service.
