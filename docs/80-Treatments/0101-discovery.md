## 0101 Discovery

**Prolog.** KARIWASE and his band stalk up on a trapper sleeping, and capture him. Bewildered, the trapper speaks in French, until Kariwase points out the English accent. Kariwase observes how the French & Indian war started, then does the same to the trapper to the excitement of his men.

**Act 1.** EPHRAIM BIGGS is a Son of Liberty on the lamb. In the rain, he arrives at his brother's (JEFFRY BIGGS) home in TOWN. Once inside and warmed, he asks his brother to shelter him. In the conversation, they argue over why he was there, which leads into the Sons of Liberty and the real reason why Ephraim is on the run. He refuses his brother, and the next morning Ephraim leaves. Make sure to show the wife & kids; she's pregnant.

Ephraim arrives in a nearby town at wilderness' edge (Smithytown) and asks a local smith CHESTER O'BRIEN to take him on for support (using an assumed name). The smith is grudging, but lets him do so. Later, Ephraim fixes a horse's hoof, foregoing compensation (overseen by Chester approvingly) He later catches Ephraim sleeping in the shop and takes pity by giving him a blanket, etc. They talk politics and Ephraim finds Chester is pro-Liberty.

MORTIMER REECE shows up at Jeffry's office a few weeks later, looking for Ephraim. In the ensuing conversation, Mortimer learns Ephraim is trained as a smith, not just a preacher. He doubts Jeffry's honesty, but will not confront him. Afterwards, he argues briefly with his 2nd man DORIAN MABBOTT about how to handle Jeffry; instead agreeing to focus on the goal of capturing Ephraim. They agree to send scouts to all the neighboring towns to find out whether a new smith has shown up. This yields fruit by finding JEFFRY BOYDELL, who Mortimer is persuaded is Ephraim.

Ephraim is working in the back of the smithy, when Dorian & MOOK-1 shows up asking to talk with Jeffry. Ephraim is immediately suspicious, and climbs the ladder to the loft. When Dorian overhears him asking Chester where he lives, he grabs what few possessions he has and uses a rope to escape through the loft's door to the ground below, obfuscated from the road. He runs into MOOK-2 who is waiting for such a move, and the ensuing fight alerts MOOK-1 and Ephraim runs away.

Dorian warns Chester that they will be back, and he, MOOK-1 and others pursue Ephraim.

Ephraim steals a horse and gallops away, under pursuit. The race goes until night, with Ephraim fretful that he escaped. He headed into the wilderness. He lets the horse go, hoping it will distract Dorian's team. Hearing their hushed voices, he realizes the hunt is not over. Through the night, he continues to evade Dorian's men. Thinking he is safe, he falls asleep, only to awake with Dorian & his nine (9) men surrounding him.

Kariwase & his band pick up on the pursuit and follow. They surround Dorian's team when they surround Ephraim. Due to the weapons, they opt to attack at dawn, when the English are the most tired. They open fire, killing MOOK-1 and alerting Dorian's men. Given they are veterans of the French & Indian War, they respond accordingly.

During the ensuing fight, Ephraim finds an opening in a large hollowed log that he crawls through. This lets him get outside Dorian's containment. As the fight shifts, he is able to emerge again after the Indians have passed, allowing him to escape their containment. He is shoeless, but able to disappear.

Kariwase's team captures or kills much of Dorian's team. MOOK-2 and two others beat a hasty retreat to civilization. Kariwase's headcount yields one missing. They find the shoes and realize he is on foot. The pursuit resumes with Kariwase's team hunting Ephraim.

Resting, Ephraim overhears the Indians, and continues to flee. They finally are able to see him on a mound and open fire. He runs like a rabbit, and falls into a hole. The Indians start to climb, when one observes it's an old haunted mound; they beat a retreat.

Ephraim regains consciousness. He is cut all over from falling down the pit. His leg hurts, but is unbroken. He has a little bit of light from the hole, which lets him find enough material to start a small fire. With the fire, he is able to expand his scope and light a torch, and build a larger fire. He realizes he cannot climb back up the hole as there is a bit of a ceiling; nor does he want to. While he explores the chamber he is in, he sees a clothed skeleton on a throne with a staff & BOOTS. He strips the boots, causing the rifle to fall over and discharge a round. This terrifies him until he realizes the staff is a RIFLE. He takes it in hand and fires it twice. He slings it, and uses the torch to explore. While exploring, he enters a lit room, which leads him to two LANTERNs. Using the Lantern, he explores further, finding a warehouse of rifles, bullets, etc. Garand thumb. He sleeps. The boots are tight, but he needs something.

**Act 2.** He finds a ground-level exit. He grabs a five rifles, two bandoleer of bullets & the two lanterns. He builds a sled and tows it away. One loaded rifle is slung across his chest.

INDIAN-MOOK-3 picks up on his trail, and quietly stalks. When they catch up with him, their over-confidence in their numbers leads them to open fire carelessly. This is the group who pursued him earlier, so their death silences the temple location.

Ephraim uses the rifle and two clips of bullets to kill them. He loots the bodies, replacing the boots with shoes that fit him. He throws the boots away, hoping they are lost in the undergrowth. He picks up one of the clips, but cannot find the other. He uses the Indians' arrows to mask the wounds. He is more cautious moving forward, worried more Indians are out & about.

Dorian emerges back to Smithytown and has MOOK-1 & MOOK-3 remain in case Ephraim survives; he is convinced he is dead but errs on the side of caution. He then starts the trip back to Philadelphia with MOOK-4. Mook-1 & -3 agree to alternate who sleeps in the loft and who sleeps in the widow's house.

Ephraim emerges a couple days later, tired. At dusk, he slips into the loft, where MOOK-3 is sleeping. Unaware, Ephraim starts grabbing all his possessions. Mook-3 awakes and calls out, scuffle & Ephraim uses MOOK-3's pistol but to knock MOOK-3 out. Ephraim finishes gathering his things, and he ladder's back down & out. He starts his trip to Philadelphia.

Next day, MOOK-1 finds MOOK-3 unconscious. Reviving him, he finds that Ephraim is still alive. Unsure what to do next, he and MOOK-3 head for Philadelphia.

Meanwhile, Kariwase discovers the slain Indian party. He initially suspects another Indian party. Further inspection discovers the missing shoes; and closer body inspection reveals the exit wounds. Looking about, they find the odd boots & a spent clip. They see the sled heading to civilization, leading Kariwase to assume it is an Englishman hauling a wounded or dead to civilization. Based on the age (dead bodies), he opts not to pursue, needing to meet with Pontiac.

Mortimer and Dorian return to Smithytown with redcoats. They confront Chester, who claims no knowledge of Ephraim's return. Unsatisfied, Chester is arrested. Mortimer orders Dorian & the MOOKs to search the neighboring towns again, the same approach as before. He takes Chester and heads to Jeffry's town with his redcoats.

Ephraim arrives in Philadelphia. He hides all the rifles near a barn on the road, hoping it won't be found. He arrives at the ROSE & CROWN PUB and quietly informs the bartender that he seeks the Sons of Liberty. He gets a room and gets cleaned up. He takes some money and buys a new outfit. While he is at the tailor, his is approached with a courier who gives him an invitation to dinner.

Ephraim arrives at the appointed time and dines with SOLOMON SHARPE & ADAIR WINSLAND (prominent citizen & SOL). Ephraim is behind on the news, which Solomon & Winsland gives him. He mentions he discovered something fantastic. He brought the lantern with him, so he first shows it. Then, he talks about the rifle, and they arrange for a rural demonstration at Winsland's farm the next day at noon.

Solomon heads to WARREN BOYDELL (check pseudonym), local customs official and spymaster. He tells him about the lantern, which Warren accuses him of being drunk. Solomon persuades him to go to Winsland's farm to see for himself. Boydell sends word to Mortimer that Ephraim was located in Philadelphia.

Meanwhile, Kariwase meets with Pontiac in the morning. They discuss the impending attack on white settlements. Pontiac instructs Kariwase to expand his trapper raids to fringe farms & towns; Smithytown & Jeffrytown being one of them. Kariwase shows him the gunpowder-smelling clip, but Pontiac dismisses it.

Ephraim's Philadelphia sighting gets to Dorian, who routes the message to Mortimer with the message that he is heading to Philadelphia.

At the same time, Mortimer confronts Jeffry about Ephraim. The two get into an argument as Mortimer is convinced that Jeffry is hiding Ephraim now. Jeffry observes "when you engage in this sort of heavy-handed inquiry, the likes of my brother are proven right." Mortimer arrests Jeffry "to deprive the fox of his den." As they start to leave town, Boydell's word of Ephraim's presence in Philadelphia. Abashed, Mortimer decides to release Jeffry on gentlemen's honor that Jeffry will not alert Ephraim. "Of course not. He is a murderer." "And a traitor. He killed one of the King's men." "That only makes him a murderer." Mortimer heads to Philadelphia.

Later that day, Ephraim, Solomon & Winsland are at Winsland's Farm. Ephraim demonstrates the rifle to the astonishment of the other two, Boydell witnesses from a vantage point, not wanting to give away Solomon's work. He has MOOK-5 follow Ephraim, but Ephraim left the rifle at Winsland's Farm and headed to Philadelphia.

Kariwase conducts a raid on Smithytown, killing the men and carrying away some women and children. The town is burned. Chester's son escapes and runs to Jeffrytown.

Boydell has Solomon entertain Ephraim over dinner a couple nights later. Dorian arrived earlier that day. At dinner, Dorian and redcoats burst in and capture both Ephraim. Dorian is unusually rough with Solomon to complete the ruse.

**Act 3.** While in the jail, Ephraim reacts to feelings of betrayal, etc. He accuses Solomon (in separate cell) of betraying him and doesn't buy Solomon's continued pleads of innocence. Winsland shows up to recover Solomon; and grudgingly agrees to send word to Jeffry.

Mortimer arrives in Philadelphia. He meets with Dorian & Solomon, where he finds out about the rifle and light. They search Winsland's Farm and do not find it. They confront Windsland who devulges its location. Mortimer tinkers with it, getting Garand Thumb as well. But, he fires it twice before burning the rest of the clip.

Ephraim and Mortimer talk about the rifle & light, with Mortimer wanting to know more. As the conversation isn't working, he has a meal in the jail with Ephraim trying to get him drunk (he is drinking tea...show the flasks being different out of Ephraim's eye line?). When Mortimer realizes Ephraim has a high alcohol tolerance, the conversation changes, but degenerates into an argument over liberty and authority. "Your sentence will be carried out." "I've not been tried yet." "You were in absentia."

Jeffry packs his bag and leaves his wife & kids before heading to Philadelphia. Word of Smithytown being attacked has reached them, but he wavers over having them come with him. He reminds them of where to hide.

Jeffry arrives in Philadelphia, and meets with Ephraim. He then meets with Mortimer, where he learns about the rifle & lantern. He tries to use the exchange of information for clemency, and rails against the "in absentianess" of the charge. "Not befitting a proper Englishman." Mortimer says he will recommend a new trial if Ephraim comes clean.

Kariwase's men attack Jeffrytown, with the similar result. Jeffry's wife & kids escape, while most of the others board up in the church. Kariwise burns the church, with he and his men watching it until the fire collapses the bell tower & the bell crashes. Cue anti-Christian/white sentiment. His men are scouring the countryside for strays, killing any they find.

Ephraim & Jeffry talk about the trial, etc. Ephraim confesses what Jeffry thought all along. This makes Jeffry despise him. "I don't care where you found them. We can figure out how they work and replace them. Sod on you." Jeffry leaves Ephraim.

Word of the raids hit Philadelphia, including Smithytown and Jeffrytown, while Mortimer tries to talk Jeffry into divulging where he found them. Hearing about Jeffrytown strikes fear into Jeffry. He is breaking down, while Mortimer starts talking about payback with the rifles. "Yes, God damn it."

Jeffry takes another go at Ephraim, who (not knowing about the raids) continues to stonewall. He's in the cell with Ephraim While Ephraim starts going on about rights and liberties, Jeffry freaks out and punches him. He blurts out about the Indian raids. Ephraim remains reluctant, because he does not want the English to get them. "Even if you lose your kith and kin? Any society that wishes that is not a society I could support." As Jeffry starts to leave, Ephraim relents on condition he can serve.

**Act 4.** Ephraim goes with Dorsey to retrieve the weapons; which leads to an unpleasant exchange over Ephraim committing murder and Dorsey being cut from the same cloth. "Would you kill me, too?" "If you get between me and what's right? Yes." Weapons & Lanterns now in hand, they head back to town.

We have a were Ephraim briefly shows how the rifles work via dry-firing (because they don't have more than a clip or two per man). Boydell insists on having a rifle and two clips stay behind in Philadelphia. That leaves four (4) rifles and 80 bullets. While training, they realize there are not enough weapons or rounds to matter.

Over dinner with Mortimer, Dorsey & Jeffry, Ephraim says there are more, "scores, maybe even hundreds." As they talk location, fear strikes Mortimer & Dorsey as they realize this trove is in the Wilderness. "If the savages get these, we will be put out of the Americas." He doesn't want to surrender the location to the English, but realizing the need agrees to take a team to the site to secure more rifles.

The next day, Ephraim is given a team of 12, a mix of veterans and novices; including the STRAND BROTHERS (ANDREW & DANIEL). While Mortimer go with a proper Redcoat regiment, Ephraim & Dorsey start off for Smithytown. While en route, they happen upon a THIRDTOWN that had been devastated. Dorsey has to talk Ephraim out of going to Jeffrytown "They will be taken or dead. Steel yourself, man."

As they head out into the wilderness, Ephraim tries to obfuscate the route, but the first night of camping Daniel Strand (surveyor) tells his brother Andrew (Smith & Tinkerer) that he has been marking the route while masking it from Indians. They arrive at the ground entrance. Once inside, Ephraim uses the other light to lead them to the warehouse. Fewer than 100. They select & hastily clean the rifles, secure ammunition. One of the team discovers the boots and decides to wear them; leading to several others donning the finely-made boots.

Mortimer & men get into a counter-siege brush with Kariwase and are beaten back initially until they use the rifles, which causes Kariwase to beat a retreat. They resume their march to Ft. Pitt, basically in pursuit of Kariwase.

All arrive at Ft. Pitt, and have a huge firefight, with the rifles slaughtering the Indians. Indian tactics of waiting until the muskets are fired is thwarted by the smokeless/repeating nature of the rifles. Kariwase wounded, not sure if I want him to escape.

Ephraim & Mortimer talk at the end, with Mortimer telling Ephraim he should disappear; and Ephraim agreeing.

Jeffry returns to Jeffrytow to find wife & kids, but a miscarriage (no birth of a nation).

Mortimer & Boydell talk about the need to take what they have and break the Iroquois' back, when Johnson arrives to suggest negotiation. "How can you beat back an entire nation with 16 rifles and a box of bullets?"

Ephraim arrives in Charleston, taking up work as a smith. He reviews a drawing what he remembered the rifle looking like.

The Strand brothers retrace their steps to the Temple; grab a bunch of tech and head to Philadelphia.

The technology reaches London, George "this changes everything."
