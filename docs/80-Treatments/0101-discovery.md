##### Ephraim's Chambersburg escape - Chambersburg / O'brien's Smithy - Day

**November 30 1762** Ephraim is working in the back of the smithy, when Dorian & Mook-1 shows up asking to talk with Jeffry. Ephraim is immediately suspicious, and climbs the ladder to the loft. When Dorian overhears him asking Chester where he lives, he grabs what few possessions he has and uses a rope to escape through the loft's door to the ground below, obfuscated from the road. He runs into MOOK-2 who is waiting for such a move, and the ensuing fight alerts _MOOK-1_ and Ephraim runs away. Dorian warns Chester that they will be back, and he, _MOOK-1_ and others pursue Ephraim. Ephraim steals a horse and gallops away, under pursuit. The race goes until night, with Ephraim fretful that he escaped. He headed into the wilderness. He lets the horse go, hoping it will distract Dorian's team. Hearing their hushed voices, he realizes the hunt is not over.

##### Ephraim captured by Dorian - Wilderness - Dawn

Through the night, he continues to evade Dorian's men. Thinking he is safe, he falls asleep, only to awake with Dorian & his nine (9) men surrounding him.

##### Kariwase ambushes Ephraim & Dorian

Kariwase & his band pick up on the pursuit and follow. They surround Dorian's team when they surround Ephraim. Due to the weapons, they opt to attack at dawn, when the English are the most tired. They open fire, killing _MOOK-1_ and alerting Dorian's men. Given they are veterans of the French & Indian War, they respond accordingly.

##### Ephraim escapes Ambush

During the ensuing fight, Ephraim finds an opening in a large hollowed log that he crawls through. This lets him get outside Dorian's containment. As the fight shifts, he is able to emerge again after the Indians have passed, allowing him to escape their containment. He is shoeless, but able to disappear.

##### Kariwase's indians pursue Ephraim

Kariwase's team captures or kills much of Dorian's team. MOOK-2 and two others beat a hasty retreat to civilization. Kariwase's headcount yields one missing. They find the shoes and realize he is on foot. The pursuit resumes with Kariwase's team hunting Ephraim.

##### Ephraim falls into the Temple

Resting, Ephraim overhears the Indians, and continues to flee. They finally are able to see him on a mound and open fire. He runs like a rabbit, and falls into a hole. The Indians start to climb, when one observes it's an old haunted mound; they beat a retreat.

#### Chapter 4 - Into the Darkness

##### Ephraim discovers technology

Ephraim regains consciousness. He is cut all over from falling down the pit. His leg hurts, but is unbroken. He has a little bit of light from the hole, which lets him find enough material to start a small fire. With the fire, he is able to expand his scope and light a torch, and build a larger fire. He realizes he cannot climb back up the hole as there is a bit of a ceiling; nor does he want to. While he explores the chamber he is in, he sees a clothed skeleton on a throne with a staff & BOOTS. He strips the boots, causing the rifle to fall over and discharge a round. This terrifies him until he realizes the staff is a RIFLE. He takes it in hand and fires it twice. He slings it, and uses the torch to explore. While exploring, he enters a lit room, which leads him to two LANTERNs. Using the Lantern, he explores further, finding a warehouse of rifles, bullets, etc. Garand thumb. He sleeps. The boots are tight, but he needs something.

### Act 2

#### Chapter 5 - Emerging from the Temple

##### Ephraim leaves the temple

He finds a ground-level exit. He grabs a five rifles, two bandoleer of bullets & the two lanterns. He builds a sled and tows it away. One loaded rifle is slung across his chest.

##### Indians pursue Ephraim

INDIAN-MOOK-3 picks up on his trail, and quietly stalks. When they catch up with him, their over-confidence in their numbers leads them to open fire carelessly. This is the group who pursued him earlier, so their death silences the temple location.

##### Ephraim uses the rifles

Ephraim uses the rifle and two clips of bullets to kill them. He loots the bodies, replacing the boots with shoes that fit him. He throws the boots away, hoping they are lost in the undergrowth. He picks up one of the clips, but cannot find the other. He uses the Indians' arrows to mask the wounds. He is more cautious moving forward, worried more Indians are out & about.

#### Chapter 6

##### Dorian heads to Philadelphia

Dorian emerges back to Chambersburg and has MOOK-1 & MOOK-3 remain in case Ephraim survives; he is convinced he is dead but errs on the side of caution. He then starts the trip back to Philadelphia with MOOK-4. Mook-1 & -3 agree to alternate who sleeps in the loft and who sleeps in the widow's house.

##### Ephraim heads to Philadelphia

Ephraim emerges a couple days later, tired. At dusk, he slips into the loft, where MOOK-3 is sleeping. Unaware, Ephraim starts grabbing all his possessions. Mook-3 awakes and calls out, scuffle & Ephraim uses MOOK-3's pistol but to knock MOOK-3 out. Ephraim finishes gathering his things, and he ladder's back down & out. He starts his trip to Philadelphia.

##### Ephraim's return discovered

Next day, MOOK-1 finds MOOK-3 unconscious. Reviving him, he finds that Ephraim is still alive. Unsure what to do next, he and MOOK-3 head for Philadelphia.

##### Kariwase inspects Ephraim's handiwork

Meanwhile, Kariwase discovers the slain Indian party. He initially suspects another Indian party. Further inspection discovers the missing shoes; and closer body inspection reveals the exit wounds. Looking about, they find the odd boots & a spent clip. They see the sled heading to civilization, leading Kariwase to assume it is an Englishman hauling a wounded or dead to civilization. Based on the age (dead bodies), he opts not to pursue, needing to meet with Pontiac.

##### Moritmer confronts Chester

Mortimer and Dorian return to Chambersburg with redcoats. They confront Chester, who claims no knowledge of Ephraim's return. Unsatisfied, Chester is arrested. Mortimer orders Dorian & the MOOKs to search the neighboring towns again, the same approach as before. He takes Chester and heads to Jeffry's town with his redcoats.

#### Chapter 7

##### Ephraim arrives in Philadelphia

In Philadelphia, Ephraim hides all the rifles near a barn on the road, hoping it won't be found. He arrives at the ROSE & CROWN PUB and quietly informs the bartender that he seeks the Sons of Liberty. He gets a room and gets cleaned up. He takes some money and buys a new outfit. While he is at the tailor, his is approached with a courier who gives him an invitation to dinner.

##### Ephraim dines with Winsland

Ephraim arrives at the appointed time and dines with SOLOMON SHARPE & ADAIR WINSLAND (prominent citizen & SOL). Ephraim is behind on the news, which Solomon & Winsland gives him.

Then, he talks about the rifle, and they arrange for a rural demonstration at Winsland's farm the next day at noon.

##### Solomon reports to the spymaster

Solomon heads to WARREN BOYDELL (check pseudonym), local customs official and spymaster. He tells him about the lantern, which Warren accuses him of being drunk.

##### Kariwase to raid settlements

Meanwhile, Kariwase meets with Pontiac in the morning. They discuss the impending attack on white settlements.

Kariwase shows him the gunpowder-smelling clip, but Pontiac dismisses it.

##### Dorian learns Ephraim's location

Ephraim's Philadelphia sighting gets to Dorian, who routes the message to Mortimer with the message that he is heading to Philadelphia.

##### Mortimer nearly arrests Jeffry

At the same time, Mortimer confronts Jeffry about Ephraim. The two get into an argument as Mortimer is convinced that Jeffry is hiding Ephraim now. Jeffry observes "when you engage in this sort of heavy-handed inquiry, the likes of my brother are proven right." Mortimer arrests Jeffry "to deprive the fox of his den." As they start to leave town, Boydell's word of Ephraim's presence in Philadelphia. Abashed, Mortimer decides to release Jeffry on gentlemen's honor that Jeffry will not alert Ephraim. "Of course not. He is a murderer." "And a traitor. He killed one of the King's men." "That only makes him a murderer." Mortimer heads to Philadelphia.

#### Chapter 8

##### Demonstration at Winsland Farm

Later that day, Ephraim, Solomon & Winsland are at Winsland's Farm.

#### Chapter 9

##### Ephraim's Reaction

While in the jail, Ephraim reacts to feelings of betrayal, etc. He accuses Solomon (in separate cell) of betraying him and doesn't buy Solomon's continued pleads of innocence. Winsland shows up to recover Solomon; and grudgingly agrees to send word to Jeffry.

##### Mortimer confronted by technology

Mortimer arrives in Philadelphia. He meets with Dorian & Solomon, where he finds out about the rifle and light. They search Winsland's Farm and do not find it. They confront Winsland who divulges its location. Mortimer tinkers with it, getting Garand Thumb as well. But, he fires it twice before burning the rest of the clip.

##### Ephraim thwarts Mortimer

Ephraim and Mortimer talk about the rifle & light, with Mortimer wanting to know more. As the conversation isn't working, he has a meal in the jail with Ephraim trying to get him drunk (he is drinking tea...show the flasks being different out of Ephraim's eye line?). When Mortimer realizes Ephraim has a high alcohol tolerance, the conversation changes, but degenerates into an argument over liberty and authority. "Your sentence will be carried out." "I've not been tried yet." "You were in absentia."

##### Jeffry to Ephraim's rescue

Jeffry packs his bag and leaves his wife & kids before heading to Philadelphia. Word of Chambersburg being attacked has reached them, but he wavers over having them come with him. He reminds them of where to hide.

##### Jeffry negotiates a solution

Jeffry arrives in Philadelphia, and meets with Ephraim. He then meets with Mortimer, where he learns about the rifle & lantern. He tries to use the exchange of information for clemency, and rails against the "in absentia" of the charge. "Not befitting a proper Englishman." Mortimer says he will recommend a new trial if Ephraim comes clean.

##### Kariwase raids Shippensburg

Kariwase's men attack Shippensburg, with the similar result. Jeffry's wife & kids escape, while most of the others board up in the church. Kariwase burns the church, with he and his men watching it until the fire collapses the bell tower & the bell crashes. Cue anti-Christian/white sentiment. His men are scouring the countryside for strays, killing any they find.

##### Ephraim & Jeffry's Break

Ephraim & Jeffry talk about the trial, etc. Ephraim confesses what Jeffry thought all along. This makes Jeffry despise him. "I don't care where you found them. We can figure out how they work and replace them. Sod on you." Jeffry leaves Ephraim.

##### Ephraim refuses despite raid

Word of the raids hit Philadelphia, including Chambersburg and Shippensburg, while Mortimer tries to talk Jeffry into divulging where he found them. Hearing about Shippensburg strikes fear into Jeffry. He is breaking down, while Mortimer starts talking about payback with the rifles. "Yes, God damn it."

##### Ephraim relents

Jeffry takes another go at Ephraim, who (not knowing about the raids) continues to stonewall. He's in the cell with Ephraim While Ephraim starts going on about rights and liberties, Jeffry freaks out and punches him. He blurts out about the Indian raids. Ephraim remains reluctant, because he does not want the English to get them. "Even if you lose your kith and kin? Any society that wishes that is not a society I could support." As Jeffry starts to leave, Ephraim relents on condition he can serve.

### Act 4

#### Chapter

##### Ephraim surrenders Philadelphia rifles

Ephraim goes with Dorsey to retrieve the weapons; which leads to an unpleasant exchange over Ephraim committing murder and Dorsey being cut from the same cloth. "Would you kill me, too?" "If you get between me and what's right? Yes." Weapons & Lanterns now in hand, they head back to town.

##### Training the Militia

We have a were Ephraim briefly shows how the rifles work via dry-firing (because they don't have more than a clip or two per man). Boydell insists on having a rifle and two clips stay behind in Philadelphia. That leaves four (4) rifles and 80 bullets. While training, they realize there are not enough weapons or rounds to matter.

##### Divulging the Temple

Over dinner with Mortimer, Dorsey & Jeffry, Ephraim says there are more, "scores, maybe even hundreds." As they talk location, fear strikes Mortimer & Dorsey as they realize this trove is in the Wilderness. "If the savages get these, we will be put out of the Americas." He doesn't want to surrender the location to the English, but realizing the need agrees to take a team to the site to secure more rifles.

##### Third raid realized

The next day, Ephraim is given a team of 12, a mix of veterans and novices; including the STRAND BROTHERS (ANDREW & DANIEL). While Mortimer go with a proper Redcoat regiment, Ephraim & Dorsey start off for Chambersburg. While en route, they happen upon a THIRDTOWN that had been devastated. Dorsey has to talk Ephraim out of going to Shippensburg "They will be taken or dead. Steel yourself, man."

##### Heading to the temple

As they head out into the wilderness, Ephraim tries to obfuscate the route, but the first night of camping Daniel Strand (surveyor) tells his brother Andrew (Smith & Tinkerer) that he has been marking the route while masking it from Indians. They arrive at the ground entrance. Once inside, Ephraim uses the other light to lead them to the warehouse. Fewer than 100. They select & hastily clean the rifles, secure ammunition. One of the team discovers the boots and decides to wear them; leading to several others donning the finely-made boots.

##### Mortimer & Kariwase engagement

Mortimer & men get into a counter-siege brush with Kariwase and are beaten back initially until they use the rifles, which causes Kariwase to beat a retreat. They resume their march to Ft. Pitt, basically in pursuit of Kariwase.

##### Battle of Fort Pitt

All arrive at Ft. Pitt, and have a huge firefight, with the rifles slaughtering the Indians. Indian tactics of waiting until the muskets are fired is thwarted by the smokeless/repeating nature of the rifles. Kariwase wounded, not sure if I want him to escape.
