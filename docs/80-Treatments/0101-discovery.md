## 0101 Discovery

**Prolog.** KARIWASE and his band stalk up on a trapper sleeping, and capture him. Bewildered, the trapper speaks in French, until Kariwase points out the English accent. Kariwase observes how the French & Indian war started, then does the same to the trapper to the excitement of his men.

**Act 1.** EPHRAIM BIGGS is a Son of Liberty on the lamb. In the rain, he arrives at his brother's (JEFFRY BIGGS) home in TOWN. Once inside and warmed, he asks his brother to shelter him. In the conversation, they argue over why he was there, which leads into the Sons of Liberty and the real reason why Ephraim is on the run. He refuses his brother, and the next morning Ephraim leaves.

Ephraim arrives in a nearby town at wilderness' edge (Smithytown) and asks a local smith CHESTER O'BRIEN to take him on for support (using an assumed name). The smith is grudging, but lets him do so. Later, Ephraim fixes a horse's hoof, foregoing compensation (overseen by Chester approvingly) He later catches Ephraim sleeping in the shop and takes pity by giving him a blanket, etc. They talk politics and Ephraim finds Chester is pro-Liberty.

MORTIMER REECE shows up at Jeffry's office a few weeks later, looking for Ephraim. In the ensuing conversation, Mortimer learns Ephraim is trained as a smith, not just a preacher. He doubts Jeffry's honesty, but will not confront him. Afterwards, he argues briefly with his 2nd man DORIAN MABBOTT about how to handle Jeffry; instead agreeing to focus on the goal of capturing Ephraim. They agree to send scouts to all the neighboring towns to find out whether a new smith has shown up. This yields fruit by finding JEFFRY BOYDELL, who Mortimer is persuaded is Ephraim.

Ephraim is working in the back of the smithy, when Dorian & MOOK-1 shows up asking to talk with Jeffry. Ephraim is immediately suspicious, and climbs the ladder to the loft. When Dorian overhears him asking Chester where he lives, he grabs what few possessions he has and uses a rope to escape through the loft's door to the ground below, obfuscated from the road. He runs into MOOK-2 who is waiting for such a move, and the ensuing fight alerts MOOK-1 and Ephraim runs away.

Dorian warns Chester that they will be back, and he, MOOK-1 and others pursue Ephraim.

Ephraim steals a horse and gallops away, under pursuit. The race goes until night, with Ephraim fretful that he escaped. He headed into the wilderness. He lets the horse go, hoping it will distract Dorian's team. Hearing their hushed voices, he realizes the hunt is not over. Through the night, he continues to evade Dorian's men. Thinking he is safe, he falls asleep, only to awake with Dorian & his nine (9) men surrounding him.

Kariwase & his band pick up on the pursuit and follow. They surround Dorian's team when they surround Ephraim. Due to the weapons, they opt to attack at dawn, when the English are the most tired. They open fire, killing MOOK-1 and alerting Dorian's men. Given they are veterans of the French & Indian War, they respond accordingly.

During the ensuing fight, Ephraim finds an opening in a large hollowed log that he crawls through. This lets him get outside Dorian's containment. As the fight shifts, he is able to emerge again after the Indians have passed, allowing him to escape their containment. He is shoeless, but able to disappear.

Kariwase's team captures or kills much of Dorian's team. MOOK-2 and two others beat a hasty retreat to civilization. Kariwase's headcount yields one missing. They find the shoes and realize he is on foot. The pursuit resumes with Kariwase's team hunting Ephraim.

Resting, Ephraim overhears the Indians, and continues to flee. They finally are able to see him on a mound and open fire. He runs like a rabbit, and falls into a hole. The Indians start to climb, when one observes it's an old haunted mound; they beat a retreat.

Ephraim regains consciousness. He is cut all over from falling down the pit. His leg hurts, but is unbroken. He has a little bit of light from the hole, which lets him find enough material to start a small fire. With the fire, he is able to expand his scope and light a torch, and build a larger fire. He realizes he cannot climb back up the hole as there is a bit of a ceiling; nor does he want to. While he explores the chamber he is in, he sees a clothed skeleton on a throne with a staff & BOOTS. He strips the boots, causing the rifle to fall over and discharge a round. This terrifies him until he realizes the staff is a RIFLE. He takes it in hand and fires it twice. He slings it, and uses the torch to explore. While exploring, he enters a lit room, which leads him to two LANTERNs. Using the Lantern, he explores further, finding a warehouse of rifles, bullets, etc. Garand thumb. He sleeps. The boots are tight, but he needs something.

**Act 2.**

He finds a ground-level exit. He grabs a few rifles, two bandoleer of bullets & the two lanterns. He builds a sled and tows it away. One loaded rifle is slung across his chest.

INDIAN-MOOK-3 picks up on his trail, and quietly stalks. When they catch up with him, their over-confidence in their numbers leads them to open fire carelessly. This is the group who pursued him earlier, so their death silences the temple location.

Ephraim uses the rifle and two clips of bullets to kill them. He loots the bodies, replacing the boots with shoes that fit him. He throws the boots away, hoping they are lost in the undergrowth. He picks up one of the clips, but cannot find the other. He uses the Indians' arrows to mask the wounds. He is more cautious moving forward, worried more Indians are out & about.

Dorian emerges back to Smithytown and has MOOK-1 & MOOK-3 remain in case Ephraim survives; he is convinced he is dead but errs on the side of caution. He then starts the trip back to Philadelphia with MOOK-4. Mook-1 & -3 agree to alternate who sleeps in the loft and who sleeps in the widow's house.

Ephraim emerges a couple days later, tired. At dusk, he slips into the loft, where MOOK-3 is sleeping. Unaware, Ephraim starts grabbing all his possessions. Mook-3 awakes and calls out, scuffle & Ephraim uses MOOK-3's pistol but to knock MOOK-3 out. Ephraim finishes gathering his things, and he ladder's back down & out. He starts his trip to Philadelphia.

Next day, MOOK-1 finds MOOK-3 unconscious. Reviving him, he finds that Ephraim is still alive. Unsure what to do next, he and MOOK-3 head for Philadelphia.

Meanwhile, Kariwase discovers the slain Indian party. He initially suspects another Indian party. Further inspection discovers the missing shoes; and closer body inspection reveals the exit wounds. Looking about, they find the odd boots & a spent clip. They see the sled heading to civilization, leading Kariwase to assume it is an Englishman hauling a wounded or dead to civilization. Based on the age (dead bodies), he opts not to pursue, needing to meet with Pontiac.

Mortimer and Dorian return to Smithytown with redcoats. They confront Chester, who claims no knowledge of Ephraim's return. Unsatisfied, Chester is arrested. Mortimer orders Dorian & the MOOKs to search the neighboring towns again, the same approach as before. He takes Chester and heads to Jeffry's town with his redcoats.

Ephraim arrives in Philadelphia. He hides all the rifles near a barn on the road, hoping it won't be found. He arrives at the Rose & Crown Pub and quietly informs the bartender that he seeks the Sons of Liberty. He gets a room and gets cleaned up. He takes some money and buys a new outfit. While he is at the tailor, his is approached with a courier who gives him an invitation to dinner.

Ephraim arrives at the appointed time and dines with SOLOMON SHARPE & ADAIR WINSLAND (prominent citizen & SOL). Ephraim is behind on the news, which Solomon & Winsland gives him. He mentions he discovered something fantastic. He brought the lantern with him, so he first shows it. Then, he talks about the rifle, and they arrange for a rural demonstration at Winsland's farm the next day at noon.

Solomon heads to WARREN BOYDELL (check pseudonym), local customs official and spymaster. He tells him about the lantern, which Warren accuses him of being drunk. Solomon persuades him to go to Winsland's farm to see for himself. Boydell sends word to Mortimer that Ephraim was located in Philadelphia.

Meanwhile, Kariwase meets with Pontiac in the morning. They discuss the impending attack on white settlements. Pontiac instructs Kariwase to expand his trapper raids to fringe farms & towns; Smithytown & Jeffrytown being one of them. Kariwase shows him the gunpowder-smelling clip, but Pontiac dismisses it.

At the same time, Mortimer confronts Jeffry about Ephraim. The two get into an argument as Mortimer is convinced that Jeffry is hiding Ephraim now. Jeffry observes "when you engage in this sort of heavy-handed inquiry, the likes of my brother are proven right." Mortimer arrests Jeffry "to deprive the fox of his den." As they start to leave town, Boydell's word of Ephraim's presence in Philadelphia. Abashed, Mortimer decides to release Jeffry on gentlemen's honor that Jeffry will not alert Ephraim. "Of course not. He is a murderer." "And a traitor. He killed one of the King's men." "That only makes him a murderer." Mortimer heads to Philadelphia.

Later that day, Ephraim, Solomon & Winsland are at Winsland's Farm. Ephraim demonstrates the rifle to the astonishment of the other two, Boydell witnesses from a vantage point, not wanting to give away Solomon's work. He has MOOK-5 follow Ephraim, but Ephraim left the rifle at Winsland's Farm and headed to Philadelphia.

Kariwase conducts a raid on Smithytown, killing the men and carrying away some women and children. The town is burned. Chester's son escapes and runs to Jeffrytown.

Boydell has Solomon entertain Ephraim over dinner a couple nights later. Mortimer arrived earlier that day. At dinner, Mortimer and redcoats burst in and capture both Ephraim. Mortimer is unusually rough with Solomon to complete the ruse.

**Act 3.**
