### Mississippi

Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Mississippi was established as a Crown colony encompassing the IRL US Southwest Territory boundaries. The Eastern boundary is established by the continental divide, with all Mississippi-basin areas South of the Ohio belonging to Mississippi. The boundary with Georgia & Carolina is separated by the Chattahoochee River with Mississippi encompassing all land West until the Chattahoochee head water, then the shortest-route to Carolina. The North boundary is the Ohio River. The West boundary is the Mississippi River. The South boundary is Spanish Florida, until Britain gains control, then it is the Gulf of Mexico. These boundaries would include portions of IRL modern-day Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and West Virginia. Mississippi will later include the modern-day cities of (TN) Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Clarksville, Murfreesboro, (MS) Jackson, (AL) Huntsville, (KY) Louisville, and Lexington. Atlanta & Tallahassee are on the Georgia side of the Mississippi-Georgia border.
