#### Pennsylvania

The colonies of New York (West of the Hudson, Manhattan, & Long Island), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are consolidated into the Province of Pennsylvania. The Western border was fixed with Charlotina as a true North-South line from Pittsburgh North to Lake Erie and South to the Mason Dixon boundary with Virginia. Pennsylvania divided their Provincial Assembly seats equally among the former colonies. There is friction as Manhattan & Long Island seek to be independent.
