### Mississippi

Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Mississippi was established as a Crown colony encompassing the IRL US Southwest Territory boundaries.
The North boundary is the Ohio River.
The West boundary is the Mississippi River.
The South boundary is Spanish Florida, until Britain gains control, then it is the Gulf of Mexico.
These boundaries would include portions of IRL modern-day Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and West Virginia.
Mississippi will later include the modern-day cities of (TN) Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Clarksville, Murfreesboro, (MS) Jackson, (AL) Huntsville, (KY) Louisville, and Lexington.
Atlanta & Tallahassee are on the Georgia side of the Mississippi-Georgia border.

The Eastern boundary is established by the continental divide, with all Mississippi-basin areas South of the Ohio belonging to Mississippi.

The Mississippi-Pennsylvania border follows the Monongahela River from Pittsburgh until it hits the Pennsylvania-Virginia border line (West Virginia, IRL) just south of Point Marion.

The Mississippi-Virginia border follows the Mason-Dixon line East from where the Mississippi-Pennsylvania line intersect it until it intersects the Northern Branch Potomac River, north of Cumberland, VA. From there it follows the IRL boundary between Maryland and Virginia until reaches the Potomac head waters at 39°14′15″N 79°29′8″W.
