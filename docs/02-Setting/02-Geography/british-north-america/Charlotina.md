### Charlotina (Ohio)

Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Charlotina was established as a Crown colony encompassing the IRL US Northwest Territory boundaries. The argument and name emerged in a 1764 Scottish pamphlet entitled _The Expediency of Securing our American Colonies by Settling the Country Adjoining the River Mississippi, and the Country upon the Ohio, Considered_.[^wiki-charlotina]

Charlotina included the region lying west of the Maumee and Wabash rivers; north of the Ohio River; east of the upper Mississippi River; and south of the Great Lakes. These boundaries would include portions of modern-day Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and the entirety of Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Charlotina will later include the modern-day cities of Chicago, Milwaukee, Toledo, Detroit, Fort Wayne, and parts of Minneapolis and St. Paul.
