### Original Thirteen colonies & Canada

Prior to about 1760, north of Spanish Florida, the Appalachian Divide represented the boundary between British and French colonial possessions in North America. After the French & Indian War, England sought to clarify the boundaries. Under the _British North America Act of 1771_, the Original Thirteen colonies were re-organized into six provinces. Each of the sections below discusses each province in a bit more detail.

#### Canada

Canada encompasses all land North of the St. Lawrence, which includes the Hudson Bay area and Quebec (both separated by the Laurentian Divide). Also added is Prince Edward Island. Areas South of the St. Lawrence were ceded to New England. The Quebecois were disenfranchised by the _Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769_ for nearly two generations.

#### New England

The colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Hampshire were consolidated into the Province of New England. This included all land South of the St. Lawrence, which extends to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and parts of Quebec. All land east of the Hudson becomes New England as well, except for Manhattan and Long Island. This led to considerable resistance by the Sons of Liberty, and led a small rebellion put down by Virginia and Pennsylvania.

#### Pennsylvania

The colonies of New York (West of the Hudson, Manhattan, & Long Island), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are consolidated into the Province of Pennsylvania. The Western border was fixed with Charlotina as a true North-South line from Pittsburgh North to Lake Erie and South to the Mason Dixon boundary with Virginia. Pennsylvania divided their Provincial Assembly seats equally among the former colonies.

#### Virginia

The colonies of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia were consolidated into the Province of Virginia. The boundary with Pennsylvania was finalized by the Mason Dixon line; consistent with the Original Timeline. The boundary with Carolina was likewise finalized along the 36°30' parallel; consistent with the Original Timeline. The Western border with Mississippi and Charlotina by the Atlantic & Mississippi Watersheds described by the Appalachian Divide. Virginia encompasses all parts of West Virginia and Virginia that flow into the Atlantic. Mississippi and Charlotina encompass those parts of West Virginia and Virginia that flow into the Mississippi.

#### Carolina

The colonies of North and South Carolina were consolidated into the Province of Carolina. The boundary with George is the Savannah River with the two tributaries of the Savannah, the Tugaloo River and the Chattooga River, form the northernmost part of the border; consistent with the Original Timeline. The Northern border is along the 36°30' as identified by King Charles II, and runs to the Appalachian Divide; consistent with the Original Timeline.[^nc-va-boundary]

#### Georgia

The colony of Georgia became the Province of Georgia. When Florida is later incorporated, Georgia extends South to capture the entire peninsula. The boundary with Mississippi is separated by the Chattahoochee River with Mississippi encompassing all land West until the Chattahoochee head water, then the shortest-route to Carolina. Its border with Carolina is consistent with its Original Timeline border with South Carolina.
