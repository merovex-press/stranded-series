## Elysion System

Elysol is a binary system comprising Elysol Senior (G2V, primary) and Elysol Junior (KV5, companion). They orbit one another with a periodicity of roughly 79 solar years, where Senior's circular diameter to viewers on Elysion from 1' to 3' wide in the sky. Junior appears 5% closer than the Sun from the Earth.

#### Elysion

Earth first became aware of Elysion via Toltec documentation. Three years before Season One, the Brits made their first successful jump through the Slipstream to Elysol and then to the Elysion Orbital.
