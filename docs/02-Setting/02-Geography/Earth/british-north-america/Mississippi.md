#### Mississippi

Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Mississippi was established as a Crown colony encompassing the unsettled region south of the Ohio river down to the Gulf of Mexico, West of the Mississippi and East of the Continental Divide. Essentially, this is the south-of-Ohio Mississippi watershed.

Mississippi will later include the modern-day cities of (TN) Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Clarksville, Murfreesboro, (MS) Jackson, (AL) Huntsville, (KY) Louisville, and Lexington.
Atlanta & Tallahassee are on the Georgia side of the Mississippi-Georgia border.

Mississippi developed slower than Charlotina due to a less benign climate and native population, until similar temples were discovered in its hinterlands. 
A strong military tradition started in Mississippi after the British government gave land grants to officer and enlisted veterans of the Seven Year's War. Similar grants were given in subsequent wars.

**Boundaries.**
The Mississippi-Pennsylvania border follows the Monongahela River from Pittsburgh until it hits the Pennsylvania-Virginia border line (West Virginia, IRL) just south of Point Marion.
The Mississippi-Virginia border follows the Mason-Dixon line East from where the Mississippi-Pennsylvania line intersect it until it intersects the Northern Branch Potomac River, north of Cumberland, VA. From there it follows the IRL boundary between Maryland and Virginia until reaches the Potomac head waters at 39°14′15″N 79°29′8″W.
The Mississippi-Carolina border...
The boundary with Georgia & Carolina is separated by the Chattahoochee River with Mississippi encompassing all land West until the Chattahoochee head water, then the shortest-route to Carolina.[^OTL-Mississippi-boundaries]
