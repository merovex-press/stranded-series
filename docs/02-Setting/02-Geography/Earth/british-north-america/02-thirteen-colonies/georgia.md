#### Georgia

The colony of Georgia became the Province of Georgia. When Florida is later incorporated, Georgia extends South to capture the entire peninsula. The boundary with Mississippi is separated by the Chattahoochee River with Mississippi encompassing all land West until the Chattahoochee head water, then the shortest-route to Carolina. Its border with Carolina is consistent with its Original Timeline border with South Carolina.
