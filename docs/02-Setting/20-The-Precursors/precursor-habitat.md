#### Precursor Habitat

The **Precursor Habitat** is a precursor orbital in a geostationary orbit over the habitable rockball below. See the specific orbitals in Season 3.

##### Description

A Precursor Habitat is a hexagonal, rotating wheel space station, 617 feet in diameter. The hexagon is 34' high and comprises three decks: Outer, Medial and Inner. The decks are outward due to the spin-created artificial gravity. Each deck has 8' high ceilings, with three feet between decks for mechanical. The width of the hexagon has a 4:9 ratio with the diameter, with the Outer deck being 137' "across the beam" and the Inner deck being 127' wide.

From the surface of Elysion, the space station's angular diameter is 1/2 the size of Jupiter's Europa, making it impractical to detect with telescopes under 60 power.

External ship access is accessed via the central hub, itself 59 feet across. The hub is connected to the hexagon via three spokes; each labeled Alpha, Beta and Gamma. The hexagon comprises three decks, Outer, Medial and Inner, each being roughly 11 feet high.

Gravity is created by the Habitat's spin (π rpm). The Medial deck has an effective gravity of 1G, with the Outer and Inner off ± 0.3G.[^spin-calc]

| # | Metric | Imperial |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Radius  | 90.61m | 297' 3-7/32" // 0.056mi // "about half a furlong"|
| Angular Velocity   |  | π rpm // 0.3289 rad/sec  // 18.849°/sec |
| Tangential Velocity   | 29.81m   | 97.97fps // 66.8mph |
| Centripetal Velocity   | 1G  |

Monolith ratio in 2001 = 1 x 4 x 9. Therefore:

Table: Overall Habitat Dimensions

| Measure | Ratio | Metric | Imperial
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Radius:| 9 | 90.61m | 297.277 or 99yds |
| Width: | 4 | 40.27m | 132' 0-1/8" or 44yds |
| Height:| 1 | 10.06m | 33' 0-1/32" or 11yds |
| Area:  | x | 7.44 hectares | 800,559 sqft or 18.37 acres  |

This provides a three-story/level space.
* Gravity on the first level is 1.02G
* Gravity on the second level is 1.0G
* Gravity on the third level is 0.91G
