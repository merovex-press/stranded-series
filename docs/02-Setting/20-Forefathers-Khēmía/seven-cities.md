### Seven Cities / Khēmi-Toltec Mounds

Seven cities remain from the Khēmía.

* Fort Discovery, near
* Cahokia, near St. Louis
* XXX, near Memphis

Most of the mounds in the Mississippi & Ohio valleys show evidence of having had things removed, with a few scraps. One mound was left oddly intact, known in our timeline as the [Toltec Mound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec_Mounds_Archeological_State_Park) (34°38'49"N 92°3'55"W) built by the [Plum Bayou culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum_Bayou_culture). The Toltec Mound site provided the trove of advanced knowledge and technology that drives this series. This trove was discovered by Ephraim George Biggs on 30 November 1782.

City of Cahokia East of modern St. Louis was inhabited to 1400, then uninhabited until about 1450 or 1550 until around 1700.
