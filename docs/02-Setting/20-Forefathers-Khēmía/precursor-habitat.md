### Khēmía Habitat

The **Khēmía Habitat** is a precursor orbital in a geostationary orbit over a goldilocks rockball; tending to be directly over a "Western" continent. See the specific orbitals in Season 3.

A Khēmía Habitat is a hexagonal, rotating wheel space station, 617 feet in diameter. The hexagon is 34' high and comprises three decks: Outer, Medial and Inner. The decks are outward due to the spin-created artificial gravity. Each deck has 8' high ceilings, with three feet between decks for mechanical. The width of the hexagon has a 4:9 ratio with the diameter, with the Outer deck being 137' "across the beam" and the Inner deck being 127' wide.

From the surface of Elysion, the space station's angular diameter is 1/2 the size of Jupiter's Europa, making it impractical to detect with telescopes under 60 power.

External ship access is accessed via the central hub, itself 59 feet across. The hub is connected to the hexagon via three spokes; each labeled Alpha, Beta and Gamma. The hexagon comprises three decks, Outer, Medial and Inner, each being roughly 11 feet high.

Gravity is created by the Habitat's spin (π rpm). The Medial deck has an effective gravity of 1G, with the Outer and Inner off ± 0.3G.[^spin-calc]

Table: Habitat Artificial Gravity

| # | Metric | Imperial |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Radius  | 90.61m | 297' 3-7/32" // 0.056mi // "about half a furlong"|
| Angular Velocity   |  | π rpm // 0.3289 rad/sec  // 18.849°/sec |
| Tangential Velocity   | 29.81m   | 97.97fps // 66.8mph |
| Centripetal Velocity   | 1G  |

Monolith ratio in 2001 = 1 x 4 x 9. Therefore:

#### Artificial Gravity &  Comfort Criteria

> This section written by Theodore W. Hall.[^theodore-hall] This information would normally be captured in my research. Lightly edited, his narration on the topic was hard to 

Artificial gravity is the inertial reaction to the centripetal acceleration that acts on a body in circular motion. Artificial-gravity environments are often characterized in terms of four parameters:

- **Radius** from the center of rotation.
- **Angular Velocity** or “spin rate.”
- **Tangential Velocity** or “rim speed.”
- **Centripetal Acceleration** or “gravity level.”

In orbital habitat design decisions are between artificial gravity and microgravity. Earth gravity is not relevant. Half of all astronauts endure “space adaptation syndrome” that lasts from one to three days when they enter microgravity.[^conners-harrison][^merz] A similar period of adaptation to artificial gravity seems reasonable, considering the substantial health benefits that it offers versus prolonged weightlessness. It may not be necessary to provide immediate perfect “comfort” in artificial gravity, especially in small exploration-class vehicles with select crew. Deliberate architectural design for the unusual conditions of artificial gravity ought to aid adaptation and improve the habitability of the environment.[^hall]

Comfort indicators are based on the following criteria:

**Radius** Because centripetal acceleration – the nominal artificial gravity – is directly proportional to radius, inhabitants will experience a head-to-foot “gravity gradient”. To minimize the gradient, maximize the radius.

**Angular Velocity** The cross-coupling of normal head rotations with the habitat rotation can lead to dizziness and motion sickness. To minimize this cross-coupling, minimize the habitat’s angular velocity.
