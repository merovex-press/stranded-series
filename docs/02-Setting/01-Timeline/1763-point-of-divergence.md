### 1763-1783: Point of Divergence

> IRL:
> The period from 1763-83 is pivotal in world history.
> By 1765, the die was cast for the conflict between Britain and the United States. We can attribute this to a greater sense of governmental autonomy built up within the American Colonies during the French & Indian War and the post-war insistence by Parliament to impose its legislative will.
> Debate on the Line of Demarcation ended in favor of the line in Fall 1763 when Parliament heard about Pontiac's War.
> The 1765 Stamp Act incensed the colonists, who were further outraged by The Declaratory Act of 1766.
> Therefore, remedying this rift is key point of divergence in _Strand_.

The Seven Year's War occurs as the fourth intercolonial war between England and France (1756-63). The war progressed as depicted in history. The relationship strain between England and its 13 American continental colonies (The Thirteen or British America) built up with increased taxation. After the Stamp Act was passed and repealed (1765-66), calmer heads prevail. The [Declaratory Act of 1766](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaratory_Act) never occurs and we diverge from our timeline.

In 1766, Parliament invited a delegation from each of The Thirteen to work out differences that included Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. This extended negotiation (1766-69) blunted Radical demands for independence. However, a splinter from the Sons of Liberty continued the (now unpopular) fight for American Independence. This splinter movement is a key area of conflict in Discovery Season.

These negotiations led to legislation that addressed British North America grievances and allowed both sides of the Atlantic to move forward in a tense harmony.

#### Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769

The Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769 extended all customary rights & privileges to native-English speaking white settlers in British North America. This created some frustration with Caribbean Colonials. Many Caribbean colonists remedied this by establishing residence in Charles Town, Carolina. However, this addressed the IRL complaints of colonialists that they were not treated to the rights they would have enjoyed had they remained home.

This disenfranchised French-Canadian residents as their native language was French. Many raised their children speaking English to extend these rights to them.

#### British North America Act of 1771

British North America sought representation in Parliament. The government agreed, providing the colonies restructured. This act transformed the continental colonies to six self-regulated provinces: Canada, New England (some called Camelot), Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York), Virginia (includes Maryland & Delaware), Carolina, & Georgia. This act further gave those provincial governments representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Ohio province is added in 1803, encompassing IRL Northwest Territory United States. Parliament calculated this reorganization of the colonies into provinces would create internal tension that would allow England to retain control.

This created frustration among the joined colonies (NY, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island & Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New Hampshire), especially RI&PP as they sought to be more tolerant religiously than Massachusetts. This is an example of Parliament's intentional friction within the provinces.

#### Rights of Religious Liberty Act of 1772

British North America sought religious liberty. Parliament sought its debts to be paid and taxation for its recurring budget. Some of this budget paid Anglican ministerial salaries. This act permitted provinces to manage their own religious affairs. This effectively abolishes the Anglican church in British North America except for Virginia and Carolina. Thus liberty was a province matter, instead of individual. The lack of Anglican minsters removes British North America's obligation to pay that portion of the budget. British North America provinces are allowed to establish their own state religions.
Virginia and Carolina remained Anglican.
Canada was not allowed to have Catholics in government, but was otherwise Catholic territory.
New England became officially Congregationalist (Puritan). Though the power of puritanism lapsed a generation before, there is still enough friction between the denominations.
Pennsylvania extended its religious tolerance through New York, making it a bastion for downtrodden faiths.

#### War Debt Equity Act of 1772

In the _quid pro quo_ for the Rights of Religious Liberty Act, British North America provinces agreed to take on half of the Government's debt incurred by the end of the French & Indian War. Whether this meant war debt or total debt was a matter of disagreement that was settled during the Napoleonic Era. The Seven Years' War nearly doubled Great Britain's national debt, so the question of whether British North America provinces accepted a quarter or half of the debt was no small issue. Buried in this act was the liquidation of various debts by prominent members of British North America society. This pushed the Sons of Liberty into the fringe by bribing the elite.
