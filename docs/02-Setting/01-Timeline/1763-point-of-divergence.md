### 1763-1783: Point of Divergence

From the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until the end of the Seven Year's War of 1763, a philosophical and political shift occurred both in America and Britain. Americans viewed Locke's Second Treatise of Government as a blueprint for social change. The British viewed it as wasted paper. Benign neglect from the 1720s to 1740s resulted in colonists assuming more control for their affairs. This neglect was shattered during the Seven Year's War, but Americans exploited the crisis with their more sophisticated understanding of politics and emerged from the War debt-free and ready to assert its independence. In England, Parliament weakened the Crown's control over politics and the prerogative system, nearly reducing the Crown to a figurehead. George III subverted that trend by taking control of Parliament in the years between his coronation in 1760 and the end of the War in 1763. This is a exemplary

Saddled with war debt and the need to protect North America, George's Parliament enacted the Sugar Act, which reduced the tax on molasses. Americans rioted and decried this as an intrusion into its home rule. The period known as the American Troubles (1763-67) were pivotal in stabilizing British-American relations and establishing the modern British Commonwealth. ^[@miller_origins_1943 pp. 33-35]
During the Troubles, Crown and Parliament exploited American internecine jealousies and prejudices to prevent this strain from flaring into mutiny. George recognized the threat to stability and had Parliament invite American colonies to send delegates to negotiate an agreement similar to the earlier home rule "Albany Plan" pitched by Benjamin Franklin in 1755. The Stamp Act of 1765 & Declaratory Act of 1766 never occur. Timelines diverge.[^OTL-American-Troubles]

[^OTL-American-Troubles]: OTL: The watershed period from 1763-1767 divided America and Britain. The Proclamation in 1763, the Sugar Act in 1764, Stamp Act of 1765 and its repeal / Declaratory Act of 1766 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 progressively strained and broke relations. As cold hostilities turned to hot war, moderates sought to halt the separation until by the 1777 Battle of Saratoga it became clear no reunification was possible.

Toltec weaponry thwarted Pontiac's Rebellion in Summer of 1763, which prevented the Declaratory Act from being enacted. Instead, King George sends a full regiment to ensure the Ohio is retained and negotiations for American home rule started.

In 1765, Parliament invited a delegation from each of the mainland colonies to work out differences that included Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. This extended negotiation (1765-68) blunted Radical demands for independence. However, a splinter from the Sons of Liberty continued the (now unpopular) fight for American Independence. This splinter movement is a key area of conflict in Discovery Season.

These negotiations led to legislation that addressed British North America grievances and allowed both sides of the Atlantic to move forward in a tense harmony.

#### Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769

The Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769 extended all customary rights & privileges to native-English speaking white settlers in British North America. This created some frustration with Caribbean Colonials. Many Caribbean colonists remedied this by establishing residence in Charles Town, Carolina. However, this addressed the IRL complaints of colonialists that they were not treated to the rights they would have enjoyed had they remained home.

This disenfranchised French-Canadian residents as their native language was French. Many raised their children speaking English to extend these rights to them.

#### British North America Act of 1771

British North America sought representation in Parliament. The government agreed, providing the colonies restructured. This act transformed the continental colonies to six self-regulated provinces:
Canada,
New England (some called Camelot),
Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York),
Virginia (includes Maryland & Delaware),
Carolina,
& Georgia.
This act further gave those provincial governments representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Charlotina province is added in 1803, encompassing IRL Northwest Territory United States. Parliament calculated this reorganization of the colonies into provinces would create internal tension that would allow England to retain control.

This created frustration among the joined colonies (NY, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island & Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New Hampshire), especially RI&PP as they sought to be more tolerant religiously than Massachusetts. This is an example of Parliament's intentional friction within the provinces.

#### Rights of Religious Liberty Act of 1772

British North America sought religious liberty. Parliament sought its debts to be paid and taxation for its recurring budget. Some of this budget paid Anglican ministerial salaries. This act permitted provinces to manage their own religious affairs. This effectively abolishes the Anglican church in British North America except for Virginia and Carolina. Thus liberty was a province matter, instead of individual. The lack of Anglican minsters removes British North America's obligation to pay that portion of the budget. British North America provinces are allowed to establish their own state religions.
Virginia and Carolina remained Anglican.
Canada was not allowed to have Catholics in government, but was otherwise Catholic territory.
New England became officially Congregationalist (Puritan). Though the power of puritanism lapsed a generation before, there is still enough friction between the denominations.
Pennsylvania extended its religious tolerance through New York, making it a bastion for downtrodden faiths.

#### War Debt Equity Act of 1772

In the _quid pro quo_ for the Rights of Religious Liberty Act, British North America provinces agreed to take on half of the Government's debt incurred by the end of the French & Indian War. Whether this meant war debt or total debt was a matter of disagreement that was settled during the Napoleonic Era. The Seven Years' War nearly doubled Great Britain's national debt, so the question of whether British North America provinces accepted a quarter or half of the debt was no small issue. Buried in this act was the liquidation of various debts by prominent members of British North America society. This pushed the Sons of Liberty into the fringe by bribing the elite.
