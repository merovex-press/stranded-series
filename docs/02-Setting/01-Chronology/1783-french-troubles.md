### 1783-1815: French Troubles

<!-- * 1783-1815 - French economy collapses due to Seven Year's War debt and speculation and takes the government with it. The French Revolution is a decade early, ends the same but with American participation in Europe.
* 1802-1815 - War between France and most of Europe. Ended by British & American deployment of Toltec weaponry -->

The French economy struggles under reparations required in the Treaty of Paris. The government gets caught up in various schemes to pay the debt that results in a popular uprising in 1783.

Napoleon is involved as a republican during the early stages of the struggle, and gains power as expected. England takes control of New Orleans when Napoleon moves on Spain, and keeps it. Napoleon sends troops in 1801, triggering the war between England and France & Spain (the latter as a vassal to France).

This "Napoleonic War" is ended by British & American deployment of Toltec weaponry in 1815. Napoleon is executed and a new French king is placed on the throne. This ends the French Troubles.

The Louisiana Territory is kept by England as compensation for the war, and to further safeguard English interest and control over Toltec artifacts.
