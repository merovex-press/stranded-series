### 1783-1848: Eradication of African Slavery

Without the American Revolution, the anti-slavery movement in England starts earlier. Over this 50-year period (1772-1848), slavery was eliminated throughout the British Empire.

* 1772 - Somerset's Case holds there is no basis for slavery in English law, and held that laws supporting slavery were against Natural Law.
* 1780 - Wilberforce's Anti-Slavery Society struggled against London Society of West India Planters and Merchants who fought against abolition of slavery.
* 1807 - During a break in the **French Troubles**, England de-legalizes trans-shipment of slaves on the Oceans and between non-connected provinces.
* 1833 - "Apprenticeship Act of 1833" ends slavery in all British holdings by stages & "apprenticeships." Chattel is immediately repudiated by Parliament, meaning that African children were born free. Slave owners were mollified by a tax break for each freeborn child. Slave owners were compensated by tax. American high-society slave owners were well-compensated, lower-class owners were not, leading to some animosity.
* 1846-48 - Apprenticeships ended in American provinces (Virginia, Carolina, Georgia) to increase representation in Parliament, leading to local civil conflicts in each province by the lower class "masters," which was put down by General Scott.
