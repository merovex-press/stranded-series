#### Society for Alien/American/Advanced Research (SAR)

**Overview.** Originally called the Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research Efforts (ST3R), the Society for Alien Research (SAR) is a limited crown company charged with deciphering Toltec technology into viable capabilities that keeps Britain globally dominant.

**Naming Confusion.** The original name owes to a misunderstanding of archeology, which was subsequently renamed in various times as either the Society for Alien (or) American (or) Advanced Research.

**The Babylonian Captivity.** ST3R operated on the grounds of Franklin's Public Academy of Philadelphia. Its move from Philadelphia to Yale under Kneass' directorship, a period known as the Babylonian Captivity by College of Philadelphia members.

#### Timeline

* 1782 November 30 - American surveyor Ephraim George Biggs discovered Toltec temple under the Arkansan Toltec Mounds. Within the mounds is a trove of technology and modern-era weaponry, including an advanced, operating computer storing alien technology. The computer and all technology was transported to Philadelphia, which is the center of American social & political life.
* 1784 April 9 - The Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research (ST3R) was chartered by King George III to decipher the technology. The Fifth French War increased the zeal of the research, with the major breakthrough occurring in 1814 discovering that the computer was a patent library exposing centuries of advanced technology.
* 1807 - Computer re-energized using what were later identified as solar panels
* 1812 - Language reverse engineered, technology deemed "Alien" instead of "Toltec," though some posit that the Toltecs are descended from Aliens.
* 1814 - ST3R realizes computer stores alien patents
* 1825 - Yale establishes the "Society for Alien Research" (SAR)
* 1826-40 - ST3R moved from Philadelphia, New Haven, Connecticut (Yale)
* 1840 - SAR returned to Salomonâ€™s House, Philadelphia
