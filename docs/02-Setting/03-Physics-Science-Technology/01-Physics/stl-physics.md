#### Slower-than-Light Travel

Slower-than-light travel follows the IRL laws of physics. Access to Toltec technology accelerates research, leading to efficient "Edison" drives.

##### Travel Times

The table below describes the constraints of space travel. Most space ships are fuel constrained based on their acceleration ability, shown by the Duration. Travel between Earth and the slipsteam is within the limits of those ships. Those with extended durations can travel four times further than regular ships, at the expense of crew comfort. Those ships could safely make it to Uranus and back, but not to the Oort cloud.

* Civilian ships never accelerate at 1G (V-shift 3) beyond a full day.
* Military ships never accelerate at 2G (V-shift 5) beyond a full day.
* Slipknot (5AU) Moon, Mars (1.5AU), Uranus (19AU), Oort (1ly) columns all refer to travel time from Earth to those (average distance) locations.
* To get 1AU, multiply Mars by 0.67 (1G = 3.7dys)

TODO: Confirm whether the numbers are based on full-time or limited acceleration.
