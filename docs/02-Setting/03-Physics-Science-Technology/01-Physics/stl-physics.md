#### Slower-than-Light Travel

Slower-than-light travel follows the IRL laws of physics. Access to Toltec technology accelerates research, leading to efficient "Edison" drives.

##### Travel Times

The table below describes the constraints of space travel. Most space ships are fuel constrained based on their acceleration ability, shown by the Duration. Travel between Earth and the slipsteam is within the limits of those ships. Those with extended durations can travel four times further than regular ships, at the expense of crew comfort. Those ships could safely make it to Uranus and back, but not to the Oort cloud.

* Civilian ships have a maximum acceleration of V-shift 3.
* Military ships have a maximum acceleration of 2G (V-shift 5.
* Slipknot (5AU), Moon, Mars (1.5AU), Uranus (19AU), Oort (0.3ly) columns all refer to travel time from Earth to those (average distance) locations. Distances between planets,[^sol-distance] Oort[^oort-distance] and Belt (1AU) [^belt-distance] are estimated for the sake of simplicity.

The table below describes the travel time between Earth and the target, as provided by the Space travel calculator.[^stl-calc]

The main (or core) population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, which are based on what is known as “Kirkwood gaps”. Named after Daniel Kirkwood, who announced in 1866 the discovery of gaps in the distance of asteroids, these gaps are similar to what is seen with Saturn’s and other gas giants’ systems of rings. https://www.notion.so/1f5ce610ebbb44d68c53e3d4c847c22d
