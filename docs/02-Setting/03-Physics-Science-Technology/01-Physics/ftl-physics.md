#### Faster-than-Light Travel Physics via Wormholes

Faster-than-light travel is possible via wormholes, known as Slipstreams. IRL, wormholes are a scientific conjecture, derived from the same equations that describe black holes. We cannot conceive of how to get to or use a wormhole. In **Strand**, however, wormholes are a convenient means of travel from one place to another. People traverse wormholes using a Jump drive, with each wormhole connecting between only two locations. Travel time is near instantaneous for the jumping ship and its occupants.

A Slipknot is the term used by Toltecs and adopted by English (Laufknoten in German, Trou de Biche (tru-de-beesh) in French, Hueco in Spanish, Orif√≠cio in Portuguese).
