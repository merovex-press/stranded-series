### Weapons Development

Weapons development in the 19th Century accelerated based on access to working Toltec weapons. Toltecs continued to use slug-throwing weapons, so this accelerates the introduction of semi- and full-automatic weaponry. Based on the Neutrino discoveries, scientists speculate the Toltec withheld their more advanced weaponry from Earth.

#### Personal Weapons

Several weapons were found in the Toltec Indian Mound Temple. Anglo-American first reverse-engineered the actual weapon as the first generation. A second iteration led to improvements.

  1803      Pennsylvania Toltec Arms, Ltd. (PTA Ltd.) chartered
            by Jacob Dickert and Martin Meylin Jr. to reverse-engineer
            & produce Toltec weapons, moved by royal request to Harper's Ferry.
  1807      First successful reverse-engineered prototype built
  1814      PTA Ltd. completed 4,000 rifles Harper's Ferry Model 1803,
            a.k.a. Toltec Battle Rifle Model '03 (HFM-03, TBRM-03 or BRM-03)
            Essentially the StG-44. This is a straight reverse-engineer.
  1815      Battle of Waterloo turned by use of the BRM-03
  1815      PTA Ltd. charter revoked. Crown forms "Harpers Ferry Arsenal"
            with the same leadership
  1819      The Model 1819 (M1819, AK-47) "Hall Rifle" replaces the BRM-03
  1808-17   Semi-automatic pistols reverse engineered and improved,
            essentially the boxy Glock is the improved result.

**Bigg's Rifle** is an 8-round en-bloc top-fed .308 caliber rifle with an injection molded polycarbonate, glass-filled stock. It has a 45 centimeter (17.7") barrel. It is remarkably similar to the M1 Tanker variant.

**Harper's Ferry Model 1803 (HFM '03 or Aught-3)** is a near-perfect replica of the Bigg's Rifle, but with a walnut stock.

#### Field Artillery

The cannon was quickly replaced by what we would consider modern field artillery.
