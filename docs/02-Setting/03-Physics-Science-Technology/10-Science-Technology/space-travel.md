#### Space Travel

This section discusses the application of slower-than-light (STL) space travel. As IRL, **Stranded** space travel involves use of reaction drives, though Toltec technology accelerated the development of very efficient drives.

##### Edison Drives

<!-- * S-250 Series Epstein Drive: A UN drive used on Leonidas-class battleships. This drive is older and less efficient than most current drive models.
* S-400 Series Epstein Drive: A UN drive used on Truman-class dreadnoughts.
* Bush shipyards Black Ops supercooled Epstein drive - CODENAME Silversmith: A drive built on Luna and secretly used on the Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates owned by Protogen.
* RT-10 'Kaminari' Epstein Drive: MCR drive used on Donnager-class battleships.
* RTF-B Series Epstein Drive: MCR drive used on Scirocco-class Assault cruisers.
* RT6-B Epstein Drive: MCR drive used on Morrigan-class Patrol destroyers.
* G-4000 Series Epstein Drive: A very large drive used on the Nauvoo/Behemoth. -->

##### Spacecraft

<!-- Do not break the reaction-based system to keep him on the planet. -->

**Design.** Spacecraft are symmetrically built around a frame. Propulsion is reaction-based, so a considerable amount of the ship's total mass is its consumable reaction material. Ships cannot travel in atmosphere as gravity will crush the frame. Travel between planet and orbitals is done through interface vehicles. **Ships are built like office towers** (Pringles cans), with small decks stacked on top of each other, which experience gravity only when the ship is under thrust.

**Travel.** When traveling, ships accelerate to the midpoint of their journey, turn around, and decelerate. No dogfights, no Immelmann or Crazy Ivan maneuvers. Safe travel means accelerating to a midpoint at 1.0-1.5 G, turn around, decelerate at 1.0-1.5 G, over a period of several days.

**Maneuvering.** Maneuver drives use liquid nitrogen or water heated to boiling point.

**Heat.** Heat is always a problem. An inability to dissipate heat can get one into trouble. Burn your engines too much, or fire too many lasers, and you start to have problems in combat yourself, because of an inability to radiate heat into the darkness of space.

**Payload.** These concerns combine to suggest that a ships payload section is relatively small (10-30% of the ship’s mass), Given the limits on payload, space for crew, weapons, cargo, and extras is limited. Slipdrives are small to allow FTL travel within the design constraints (i.e. we wanted ships both with slipdrives and with guns), and so the limit on FTL travel comes from the point of departure, well above the ecliptic of the system.
