> Sure! The parliament consists of two coalitions, the Democrat Coalition with The Social Opportunity Party, Democrats, The Outlook Party, and Centre Party. The Republican Coalition meanwhile is, The Founding Fathers Party, Republicans, New Christians, and American Patriot Party.

> The Social Opportunity Party (SOP) is a relatively young party, founded in the 90's with much stronger communist ties than today. Nowadays the party is aligned much more to the centre than before and is more social democrat than communist.

> The Democratic Party (D) is fairly unchaged from what you know, it's just not as popular.

> The Outlook Party (OP) is an attempt by concerned Americans to focus on enviromentalism. While it's grown a bit in the past few years it remains a fringe party.

> Centre Union (C) is one of the older parties, during the Cold War this truly was the party between the D and the R and stood as the neutral barrier betwen the two. However In the 90's and 00's the party drew closer and closer to the Democrats and in 2010 it joined the Democrat Coalition.

> Founding Fathers Party (FFP) has not been taken very seriosly throughout history and has been seen as a radical, right wing, fringe party. In later years the party mellowed down though and saw huge success in 2016, gaining more seats than ever before.

> The Republican Party (R) is.. well, yeah you know this one too.

> New Christian Americans (NCA) is the go-to party if maintaining a devout nation is your main concern. The name was changed in 1999 to include new after a series of disastrous election results.

> American Patriot Party (AP) has recently taken the name of the most radical party in parliament. It saw huge success after 9/11 and has remained much larger than it ever was before 2001.
