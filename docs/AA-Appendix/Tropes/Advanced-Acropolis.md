### Advanced Acropolis

In the dark heart of Africa lies the Shining City of Wakanda. â€¦what? It's night time!

The development and advancement of human civilization has been greatly spurred by tech sharing (or spying) between cultures and peoples as ideas are traded. While some have advanced socially, culturally and/or technologically faster than others thanks to internal stability and enlightened rulers, it's rare for a single society (much less city-state) to advance leaps and bounds ahead of its neighbors while keeping all its advances to itself.

Except in fiction, that is.

A common setting in [pulp](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pulp) stories is the search or surreptitious discovery of an Advanced Ancient Acropolis. Hidden beneath the Earth in a [Lost World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWorld), an [Atlantis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis) under the sea, or concealed with advanced technology or magic, the Advanced Ancient Acropolis is the last city of an empire that reached space age [levels of technology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology) and/or [mythic magical powers](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeOfMyth). In some cases, [it is an isolated city-state rather than one of an empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfOneCity). Their claim to fame is that while the rest of the world was living in mud huts [they had built a society](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadeDissonance) of [Crystal Spires and Togas](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas) and parked it in a comfortable [Technological Stasis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis). All while [never revealing its existence](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage), though ancient legends of [The Time of Myths](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTimeOfMyths) may speak of them.

Bonus trope points for avoiding all social decay while being completely insular, double bonus if they use [Cultural Posturing](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing) on the "inferior" civilization the heroes hail from. One common variation has the Advanced Ancient Acropolis be in the same abandoned and ruined state as the one in Greece, having been destroyed, abandoned, [sunken](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity), [buried](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundCity), wrecked from civil war, plague or some other [misfortune](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnAge). There might however [be a last survivor](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingRelic) in the form of a robot, golem, ghost, or immortal citizen. Sometimes this may expand to include the descendants of the original culture who have regressed into a simpler stage and scavenge in their ancestors' ruins. Heroes visiting these sites are advised that any [ancient relics found](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology) are likely of the [dangerous](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DurableDeathtrap) [cursed](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse) or [Lost Superweapon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostSuperweapon) varieties.

Of course, all of this can be explained if the founders of the city were [aliens](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien) or from a [Higher-Tech Species](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies), or the survivors of a cataclysm that reduced the rest of the world to a lower level.

Common deconstructions frequently focus on just how [decadent](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist) and out of repair such a society can become, which may in fact be [what leads to their ruin](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoiledCityOnAHill). Frequently, this is because their slave race of robots (or actual slaves) [rebelled](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters).
