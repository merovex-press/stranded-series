### Low Culture, High Tech

*"The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite."*

While you don't need to know how a gun works to know how to use one, the society as a whole must be able to support the thinkers and builders of such a device for it to see widespread and sustained use. Not so when you have Low Culture High Tech; this is a faction, culture, or race that uses technology far in advance of their scientific and cultural knowledge, often for warfare.

Usually [this group has pirated the technology from someone else](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ETGaveUsWifi). It may be [Lost Technology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology) that they have recovered and use, often very sturdy, self-replicating lost tech that only requires raw materials be input, if even that. Or it could be a [Black Box](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox) tech that none of their existing machines can do without. There may instead be a group of "thinkers and builders" who use the primitives as shock troops or even as a [Slave Race](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace). It's also possible the tables are turned and the primitives have either taken the builders hostage or killed them all and taken all of their goodies (without bothering [with the instruction manual](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup)). If the original source of the tech is [Shrouded in Myth](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth), they may become a [Cargo Cult](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult).

Typically, the primitives will only use a fraction of the technology's potential and not know all of its abilities. At best they will be able to maintain the equipment without knowing how to repair it should a major malfunction happen. It's highly possible that the original creators, or a group with sufficiently advanced science (even just curiosity and a working knowledge of the scientific method), can pull the rug out from under these primitives by either confiscating, hacking, or better using their pirated tech against them.

It's worth noting that a civilization doesn't have to be at stone age or [Medieval](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture) levels of technology for this trope to apply. They just have to routinely use tech far in advance of their ability to comprehend. A story set in 21st century Earth could have this trope apply if the planet were given [Imported Alien Phlebotinum](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum). Even space faring peoples can have [Low Culture, High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech) if they use stuff they don't understand.

Lastly, we want to draw attention to the following from the first paragraph "far in advance of their scientific and **cultural** knowledge". It's important to point out that not only are they using things they don't understand technologically, but for which they haven't considered the cultural, social, or ethical ramifications. It's one thing to give a hunter-gatherer society an [Energy Bow](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBow), but giving them a cloning device? Their society may crumble from the onset of massive [Cloning Blues](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues), not to mention the ecological disaster of the massive population growth. It's because of this that many aliens (and future humanity) tend to subscribe to an [Alien Non-Interference Clause](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause) or a [You Are Not Ready](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady) attitude.

Related to [Insufficiently Advanced Alien](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufficientlyAdvancedAlien), which is about a race that's interstellar, but every other tech they have sucks comparatively, *and* they probably don't understand it. Compare [Crystal Spires and Togas](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas). Contrast [Rock Beats Laser](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser). The [Noble Savage](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage) inverts this trope, being essentially High Culture, Low Tech. See also [Bamboo Technology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology), [Aliens Never Invented the Wheel](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel), [Scavenger World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld), [Giving Radio to the Romans](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingRadioToTheRomans), [Technology Uplift](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift) and [Cargo Cult](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult). Not to be confused with "[High Tech and Low Life.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk)" Compare [Klingon Scientists Get No Respect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect), when a society undervalues the profession that make its desired lifestyle possible. Not to be confused with [No Tech but High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTechButHighTech).
