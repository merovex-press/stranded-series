### Blood Knight

"...HAVE AT THEE!"

![][Wl2wSkfC]

Fighting is everything to the Blood Knight. He *lives* for it. It's not so much about winning or losing, morality, the motives of his allies, or even [the glory][8YZ36INZ], that drives this guy so much as it is the opportunity for a good fight.

A Blood Knight can be of any morality whatsoever, although [Anti Heroes][u0ObArmO] and [Anti Villains][T1JTqSvg] tend to be most common.

Heroic examples will frequently be [The Big Guy][5AO8omI0] in an ensemble, the character most likely to solve his problems by force of arms. They might make the less violent members of the crew a little nervous, especially if they go off on a [hair trigger][Owwr10io]. He may merely enjoy the challenge and not hurting others necessarily; some don't hurt people unprovoked since they have a sense of right and wrong.

The Blood Knight doesn't even have to be a particularly violent man most of the time. A common version found in Eastern fiction is the Wandering Martial Artist, who [Wanders the Earth][6n9nyaLq] looking for strong opponents to test his skills against. This might be coupled with a love of fair duels and a desire to [challenge][7dnaJisw] the [best and strongest][lrtGZFKZ]. This type still enjoys the thrill of the fight, but usually eschews the death and bloodshed aspect. A living opponent, after all, can improve their skills and provide an even better challenge later. [Defeat Means Friendship][NTCSooGt] is a common occurrence with these guys, their opponent's or their own.

As an antagonist, he has a good chance of being an [Anti-Villain][T1JTqSvg], since he doesn't want to kill the heroes, necessarily, just fight them. If he can find someone [tough enough to beat him][NTCSooGt] he might undergo a [Heel–Face Turn][4ddyN6KV] and join the hero's team, or simply gain a [newfound respect][n7LzcJdO] for his foe that he [didn't have before][xSMzlNtw]. He might deliberately disadvantage himself in order to make fights last longer and loves to reveal that [he is not left-handed][w3ZnU22j]. Despite the brutality that this trope implies, it's not uncommon for them to be a [Noble Demon][1iLD0xRO] as well when they want an exciting fight on *specific terms* or when they reject unfair advantages because it would make the fight no fun. He may even betray his boss if he insists on interfering to [pursue and obsess][lBfukRYT] over his [foe][B9FcHDEW] on his own terms. Less pleasant ones may [do all kinds of horrible things][fySftJb4] to provoke their opponents into fighting them. Though if they specifically love to kill (rather than fight) they are a [Psycho for Hire][ffygDGaN].

Personality-wise, more evil ones may be a [Flat Character][I8c8GuS9] (and quite possibly [The Brute][JMPoKDNg]) who just shouts ["Maim! Kill! Burn!"][G4RmY0dD]. Good/[Sympathetic][T1JTqSvg] ones are usually more sophisticated/developed and can have aspects of the [Warrior Therapist][HLHEVKhg], [Warrior Poet][lMZ37H5w] or [Cultured Warrior][VpmxUQ6I]. He might be a [normal, jocular guy][jJapQwqJ] when he's not brawling, or he might take the fight so seriously that [he blocks out everything else][m6t0OFPg] and will therefore live only for battle. In some cases, the Blood Knight fights because he's [looking for a way to die with meaning][nQOjGvHQ].

A [War God][T3JPzWrI] is very often one of these though he could also be [Ax-Crazy][7zRo270J] or just [The Sociopath][yKKrXD8t]. If there's a whole society of guys who like combat, you've got a [Proud Warrior Race][iJeuyt4b]. If the character likes the 'killing' part more than the 'fighting' part, they're a [Psycho for Hire][ffygDGaN]. The [Egomaniac Hunter][EisKT81j] also thrives on aimless violent thrill and loves a worthy quarry instead of an opponent. If a character is in it for the challenge rather than just the fight, then we've got a [Spirited Competitor][lrtGZFKZ]. The Blood Knight's love of combat may be platonic, or it may have [sexual undertones][fCDTWkPw]. It could also overlap with [Ax-Crazy][7zRo270J] if their love of fighting crosses the line into psychopathic violence and mental and emotional instability.

[Sub-Trope][mQM4b4iB] of [In Harm's Way][xtbR5r4W]. [Sister Trope][OYSiT6UH] to [Combat Sadomasochist][bCT1i3MP], [The Real Man][QD2QFNfT], and [Boisterous Bruiser][jJapQwqJ]. Compare [Cavalier Competitor][i6ocNpLN] and, for a more general trope, [Challenge Seeker][7dnaJisw]. Also compare [Sadist][OFUvPqWd], whose favorite part of fighting is the pain and suffering of his opponent. May be from a [Martyrdom Culture][2rTfKSTe] and will nearly always believe that [War Is Glorious][yyS5CV3Y]. If he (or she, though it's much rarer, however; see [Lady of War][KJTy7GmN]) is in the military, then he will almost inevitably be a [Colonel Kilgore][tJ2lki0n]. A [Monster Knight][aXYfXuSP] has a high chance of being one. A more violent example that nonetheless fights on the side of good may (or may not) be a [Sociopathic Hero][OasPdJsM]. It also has [nothing to do with][icrOJad4] a knight who uses [Blood Magic][TsBq59Ah]. Contrast [Shell-Shocked Veteran][Kst7SKRY], who is of the opposite mindset (also contrast [War Is Hell][YlxlrGDi]).

Oh, just in case it wasn't clear, the character doesn't have to be a literal knight for this trope to apply. It is about the attitude, not the rank.

#### Blood Knight / Playing With

**Basic Trope**: Someone who enjoys fighting.

- **Straight**: Bob loves a good fight and picks a profession that allows him to seek out worthy opponents and enjoys proving his skills against them in battle.
- **Exaggerated**:
    - Bob cannot go a week without getting into some kind of fight just to alleviate boredom if nothing else.
    - Bob starts a religion where brutally murdering your enemy is the best way for his salvation. And for the salvation of his enemies. Or Bob uses elements of "sacred sexuality" like in Tantrism, but replaces everything sexual with the joy of killing his enemies.
- **Downplayed**: Bob enjoys fighting against skilled opponents, but doesn't go out of his way to seek them out.
- **Justified**:
    - As a member of a militaristic culture that glorified warfare and prowess of the battlefield, Bob is merely acting according to his culture's expectations of a good warrior.
    - He started out his [rampage as a revenge][rsGAjpSu], but in the end, he ended up obsessed with fighting.
    - He spills the others' blood [to ease his thirst][sjsLrNzh]. And since nutrition is a pleasure on itself...
    - Combat provides a *massive* adrenaline rush. Bob fights to get the ultimate high.
- **Subverted**: Bob enjoys proving his skill on the battlefield until he meets an opponent that grossly outclasses him in terms of skill. He then finds that fighting is less fun when you're getting your ass kicked.
- **Double Subverted**: Bob's beatdown motivates him to train harder so he can defeat his opponent.
- **Parodied**: Everytime Bob hears about a fight, he immediately goes berserk and runs at the place to start yelling "KILLBURNKILL!!!" and swinging the first heavy object he found and picked up left and right.
- **Zig Zagged**: Whether or not Bob is enjoying a fight depends on a variety of factors, sometimes he's having the time of his life, other times he's just as stressed as everyone else.
- **Averted**: Bob may be a warrior, but he doesn't enjoy fighting in the slightest
- **Enforced**:
    - The writer wants to portray the negative aspects of being obsessed with violence.
    - The writer finds "he goes looking for fights" more realistic as a plot device than "[all the fights come to him][4ni2cnVd]".
- **Implied**: Whenever Bob is in open combat, he seems much more relaxed than in everyday situations.
- **Lampshaded**:
    - "It's been like four days since anybody needed me to punch them. [I. Am. So. BORED.][y3xgDG8B]"
    - "Doesn't he have another fun in his life?"
- **Invoked**: Bob was [raised from birth][zZCFcecU] to love fighting and violence so that he could serve as [The Heavy][AAyI6Lth] for the local [Big Bad][fHDZdx4L].
- **Exploited**: Bob is easy to manipulate, because his love of fighting gets in the way of his critical thinking when it comes to things like "Should I be fighting this guy in the first place?"
- **Defied**: Bob isn't hesitant about fighting when it's necessary, but refuses to let it become something he enjoys for its own sake.
- **Discussed**: "If there's anything I've learned, [Enyo][TMDVGMzX], it's that if you show yourself to be strong, you'll have people lining up to fight. Thus, I want everyone to know how strong you are, so I can find a few combat-addicts to help further defend my plans."
- **Conversed**: "People who like fighting are always written as battle-lusty maniacs — as in, literally, they all but cum in battle, and in an X-rated show they go *that* far, too. It's always like that. You'd think writers would give them a bit more nuance nowadays."
- **Deconstructed**:
    - Bob's tendencies to seek out worthy opponents leads to him getting killed.
    - Bob's love of battle leads him to escalate a situation that could have easily been defused peacefully. He is abandoned by his comrades after the destruction his actions indirectly caused.
    - The person he fights for publically begs him to stop fighting.
- **Reconstructed**:
    - Bob knows his aggressive tendencies put him at risk of doing something stupid, so he emphasizes self-control and learns to enjoy his moments of delayed gratification.
    - Bob is a [Martial Pacifist][6eS4ebwl] who deeply enjoys fighting, but also knows that there is a time and place for it.
    - In the end, Bob loses everything, he gets ostracised by everyone he wanted to defend, gets betrayed and outright killed. Hundred years later, even his enemies consider him a hero because he fought for what he believed, no matter the cost, and risked everything for his values.
- **Played For Laughs**: Bob treats fighting like any other form of entertainment. When everyone goes to the cinema, he goes to the boxing club, and going to war is his idea of a perfect vacation.
- **Played For Drama**:
    - Bob can seldom find any enjoyment in anything other than combat. Despite having been injured multiple times and being ridden by guilt over the times he had to kill someone, he continues to do the only thing that, in his opinion, makes his life worth living.
    - Bob is a [Death Seeker][nIZKOig7] [who can't commit suicide][QKuWKe0c] because it would be [dishonorable][jPFZD177]. Therefore he tries to find [someone who can kill him in a fight][Ua9xr2he].
- **Played For Horror**: Bob is shown laughing with joy, while his fallen enemies scream in pain at his feet.
