### Absent Aliens

*"I remember telling my college professor I wanted to study Xenoarcheology. He laughed right in my face. 'There’s nothing to study,' he said. 'It’s all dead space. No alien life exists out in the universe.' In a way, I guess he was right..."*

Humanity has [explored the galaxy, and in some stories the universe][FsNUD7SB], and it turns out the truth *isn't* out there. There are no aliens, or at least, no intelligent ones.

**Done for a variety of reasons:**

- Not every sci-fi plot requires aliens.
- Avoids [Rubber-Forehead Aliens][GqX8Vioh], and saves having to think up decent [Starfish Aliens][xlF6LiU0].
- Isolates humanity in the depressing void of space.
- Saves on the effects budget.
- Makes it easier to make characters [relatable and believable][EG3VzInS].
- Is consistent with the fact that no aliens have yet been found. (See [Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness][2sEX3v1f].)
- Even if aliens did theoretically exist, in settings where the population is confined to a single star system and there is no FTL, neither humanity nor the aliens would be in any position to encounter the other.
- Theoretically, intelligence could be a rare evolutionary fluke, rare at least elsewhere in the Milky Way. Even if intelligence evolves on other planets, it may be extinct by the time humans leave the Solar System, or alternatively, humanity could be extinct by the time aliens leave *their* home system. Thus, even interstellar civilizations may be separated by immense distances or timescales, and unlikely to interact.
- The focus of the Sci-Fi in question is a political struggle between human populations, and aliens could either help them resolve their differences or serve as a threat encouraging them to do so themselves.
- Is free of the [Unfortunate Implications][r8KSGfxj] that cultures that spent time building monuments and functioning societies [lacked the intelligence to do things like that on their own][7tzNe2qF], or that "low-tech" is synonymous with "backwards".
- Raises the [Driving Question][zERAZ2L5] of what happened to the aliens, and whether humanity could be next.

There may be a few cursory alien plants and rodents or perhaps a [Monster of the Week][rX7Nq7OF], which is generally filled by humans, genetically engineered monsters, and robots. An ongoing work does not have to stay this way; it can provide a [Game Changer][LjioIOaM] with [First Contact][KCTXBOEj] when the writers need to shake things up.

One of two standard solutions to the [Fermi Paradox][Wuwb29XT]; the other is [Invisible Aliens][ssGcqtp7], in which aliens exist but are being hidden or removed by [Applied Phlebotinum][UIWzLzRL].
