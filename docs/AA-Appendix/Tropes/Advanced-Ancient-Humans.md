### Advanced Ancient Humans

This trope is when modern-day/near-future humans discover that they actually had a super advanced society eons ago, in pre-history. In other words, *Homo sapiens* are their own [Precursors][pt2Rj4Bc]. This prehistoric civilization, for whatever reason, fell or disappeared before our recorded history began, thus explaining why nobody knew about it before. Oftentimes they lived in an [Advanced Ancient Acropolis][pCEvxbEm] which they'll leave behind for present explorers to marvel at.

Compare [Human Aliens][OQfShY9V], [Adam and Eve Plot][1JYuvEYf], [Earth All Along][LrZZsZqF]. For a specific subtrope of this, see [Atlantis][f9CbYB3w] (depending on how advanced it's depicted as being). For *any* species that came before us, including aliens, see [Precursors][pt2Rj4Bc]. Compare [Ultra Terrestrials][nlkpBiZh], when an alien species turns out to also be from Earth but developed and left way in pre-history (before humans were around). Often overlaps with [Humanity Came From Space][jki7VDm6]. When the story is set in a future where humanity is extinct, see [Humanity's Wake][nueGQCNc]. See [Humanity Is Advanced][DbQvPd7d] where humanity is the current Advanced Alien. If we have evolved to the point these guys are not immediately recognizable as human they may also be [Original Man][OsUKMvLV].
