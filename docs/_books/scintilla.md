On the verge of earning a plum job in government, pampered Mondennio Rownzal Clin-Khotaigra is is kicked out of university after being falsely accused of cheating.

He struggles to clear his name, only to be implicated in the murder of a magistrate.

Confronted with the injustices of Copa's clinate system, Mondennio must reconcile his doubt in his government's legitimacy against Jonaldy Amonett's efforts to compel him to be an agent for the Imperium.
