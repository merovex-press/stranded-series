## Themes & Concepts

<!-- ## Theme, Style & Tone -->

<!-- In contemporary literary studies, a theme is a central topic a text treats. Themes can be divided into two categories: a work's thematic concept is what readers "think the work is about" and its thematic statement being "what the work says about the subject". Themes are often distinguished from premises. -->

### Themes

THEMES are Unifying Subjects

Themes provide the idea-space the production and story will play out in and which will unify otherwise disparate storylines and characters.

Themes shouldn’t present arguments or perspectives but rather be the macro-level topic to be explored. It provides a touchstone of reference for any given episode. "How does each episode, each character explore the themes?"

Love, Justice, Revenge, Redemption, Betrayal, Hope, Progress, Power, Corruption… Big dynamic emotive words make great themes for unifying a series.

[TV Trope Central Theme](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme) has a good primer.

* A good place to start thinking about the theme of the work is the conflict it depicts; what is the overall conflict of the story, where does it originate, and what questions or thinking points does this conflict prompt? -->

<!-- ### Concepts

CONCEPTS represent the "what if" questions of your series. Strong concepts are often the result of bringing together things that otherwise don’t belong, or scenarios that are extraordinary in some way as to prompt questions on the mind of an audience.

Concept overview should be like:

>Person of Interest is an American science fiction crime drama television series.
>John Reese, a former CIA agent who is presumed dead.
>He is approached by a mysterious billionaire named Harold Finch who is trying to prevent violent crimes before they happen by using an advanced surveillance system dubbed "The Machine" that provides the SSN of a POI (person of interest) who will be involved in an imminent lethal crime as either a perpetrator or a victim. (The episode driver)
>Their unique brand of vigilante justice attracts the attention of two NYPD officers, Joss Carter and Lionel Fusco, whom Reese uses to his advantage as he investigates the POI.
>Reese and Finch are later aided by Samantha "Root" Groves, a highly intelligent computer hacker and contract killer whom the Machine later identifies as its "analog interface", and Sameen Shaw, a former ISA assassin who unknowingly dealt with the "relevant" numbers found by the Machine.
>During the course of the series, 103 episodes of Person of Interest aired over five seasons.

**Logline.** Wrongfully accused of murder, anthropologist Albert Strand flees the orbital to the alien world below. Albert must adapt to the alien society and its intrigues, and decides to use his superior understanding of technology to his advantage. -->
