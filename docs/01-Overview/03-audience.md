## Audience

<!-- audience -->
In AUDIENCE you should clearly define your target audience; not just by age or gender but also by demographic, interests, habits, other media they consume, other activities they engage, what professions they occupy, what beliefs or values they may hold. Audiences are not so simplistic as to be defined simply by how old they are and what sex they areâ€¦!

Also take into consideration the audiences of other shows and aim your project to appeal to the same audience as a similar series, or one in the same style or genre.

If possible specify the network, broadcaster or channels most appropriate.
