## Format

<!-- format-overview -->
**Stranded** is a series of novellas, broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 10 novellas as "chapters." This follows the [UK drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) or [Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) series season length. (See [research](research/season-episode.md))

Seasons follow three intertwined storylines: combat, espionage/technology and diplomacy.

* Combat - this storyline deals with the use of force.
* Espionage - this storyline deals with exploration and theft of the ancient technology by various factions.
* Diplomacy - this storyline addresses changes in sectarian and international politics.

A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel. (See Audience) Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but the storylines will either be incomplete or hinting at the future.

### Rationale

Each season comprises 10 novella episodes (30,000±2,500 words or 80±8 pages).
Each season is 240,000 words, or about three 80,000 word novels.
Each novella comprises 8 three-scene segments or 24 scenes (~1300 words per scene).
Each scene services a different storyline.

Box sets will comprise five books where each book is two episodes.

* Reading
  - Reading pace: Average adult reading time is 220wpm.
  - Therefore, each novella should take about 2.5 hours to read ± 10%
  - At $2.99, a season costs the reader $29.99 and makes the author $20.93.
  - A printed season should also cost $30 as it comprises the equivalent of 3 novels ($29.88)
* Listening
  - Listening pace: Audible standard voice pace is 125wpm.
  - A novella should complete in about 4hours.
  - A series should complete in about 40 hours.
  - Sell [Audible](https://www.acx.com/help/what-s-the-deal/200497690) at the series, making $3 per sale, $6 if I record it myself.

### Season Pattern

The following is the season pattern, as well as the per-episode structure.

1. **Stasis** - Everyday life, ends with inciting incident
2. **Trigger** - Beyond control triggers the story
3. **Quest Fail 1-3**
4. **Quest Fail 2**
5. **Quest Fail 3**
6. **Surprise** - Something unexpected to reader and character ruins the quest.
7. **Critical Choice** - Character makes a decision that reveals the character's true nature
8. **Defeat / Climax** - Critical choice leads to the darkest moment.
9. **Reversal** - Character reverses behavior as a result
10. **Resolution** - New stasis.

We plot the episodes in order: 10, 1, 6, 2-5, 9, 7, 8.
