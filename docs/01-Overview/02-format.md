## Format

<!-- format-overview -->
**Stranded** is a series of novellas, broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 10 novellas as "chapters." This follows the [UK drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) or [Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) series season length. (See [research](research/season-episode.md))

A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel (TODO: [#31](https://github.com/Merovex/stranded-series/issues/31), audience psychographics). Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but leave the reader wanting the next one.

This is an alt-history Science Fiction series. Need to explain the genre (horror, comedy, etc.) Loop in the major tropes.

### Season Pattern

The following is the season pattern, as well as the per-episode structure.

1. Stasis
2. Trigger
3. Quest Fail 1
4. Quest Fail 2
5. Quest Fail 3
6. Bolt
7. Shift
8. Defeat
9. Power
10. Resolution

We plot the episodes in order: 10, 1, 6, 2-5, 9, 7, 8.

**1x10. RESOLUTION** Plot out of order, so the first thing we do is decide who our character will be at the end of the story. To do this, we can simply select one or two “states”, such as: wealthy, fearless, loving, sociable, etc.

**1x01. STASIS** The next step is to turn the character’s Resolution state into its opposite. This gives us their state at the start of the story, and allows us to create a strong character development arc. For example, a character who’s wealthy at the end of the novella would begin poor, a character who is fearless would start out scared, etc. The Stasis will show the character in their ordinary, everyday life, exhibiting these states.

**1x06. SHIFT** Next, we find the turning point between the Stasis and the Resolution: this is the stage at which the character realizes how they can make the transition from their old ways to their new ones, in order to fulfill their goal or create a new, better goal.

**1x02. TRIGGER** The Trigger is what sets the character off on the story journey. This is through either internal or external motivation, or a combination of both. Ephraim discovers the tech, and decides this is a way to get rid of the English.

**1x03-5. QUEST** The Quest is the stage at which the character gets sucked deeper and deeper into the adventure. They meet new people, visit new places, discover new problems, and take on new responsibilities. Some of the people they meet may be shapeshifters, and they will need to be sorted out from the allies. These allies will form a plan and put it into action. Usually, it won’t be a very good plan but the character will go along with it because it’s the best plan they have.

**1x09. POWER** The Power is the counterpart of the Quest. It acts in reverse and extracts the character from the world of adventure. This is where the character truly understands that they’ve had the power to change into their Resolution state all along. They make the change and fulfill their original or altered Quest goal.

**1x07. BOLT** The Bolt is the “bolt from the blue” that derails the (already weak) Quest plan. This could, for example, be the point at which a shapeshifter’s betrayal is discovered, or when the allies realize that they’ve critically misjudged their opposition. It can also take the form of a diversion or delay that takes the character’s focus away from making progress on the Quest.

**1x08. DEFEAT** The Defeat is the moment when all hope is lost. The Quest plan that faltered in the Bolt has now completely fallen apart. The Defeat follows on from the Shift, and often involves an essential sacrifice that the character must make in order to attain their Resolution state.
