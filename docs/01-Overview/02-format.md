### Overview

<!-- format-overview -->
**Stranded** is a novella series broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 10 novellas as "chapters." This follows the [UK drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) or [Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) series season length. (See [research](research/season-episode.md))

**Pattern.** Seasons follow three intertwined storylines: combat, espionage/technology and diplomacy.

* Combat - this storyline deals with the use of force.
* Espionage - this storyline deals with exploration and theft of the ancient technology by various factions.
* Diplomacy - this storyline addresses changes in sectarian and international politics.

**Reading Length.** A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel. (See Audience) Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but the storylines will either be incomplete or hinting at the future.
