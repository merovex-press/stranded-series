## Format

<!-- format-overview -->
**Stranded** is a series of novellas, broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 12 novellas as "chapters." This follows the [UK drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) or [Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) series season length. (See [research](research/season-episode.md))

A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel (TODO: [#31](https://github.com/Merovex/stranded-series/issues/31), audience psychographics). Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but leave the reader wanting the next one.

This is an alt-history Science Fiction series. Need to explain the genre (horror, comedy, etc.) Loop in the major tropes.
