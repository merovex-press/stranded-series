## Concept & Theme
<!-- concept-overview -->
**Stranded** is  a Type-X [Fantastical], [alternative-history] series written by Ben Wilson.

In the 18th Century, British-Americans uncover an [Ancient Acropolis] that introduces ([advanced, ancient human]) [Lost Technology] in the Ohio Territory at the end of the Seven Year's War. This leads to [America remaining in the UK] despite continued struggle by the Sons of Liberty. Britain becomes a [Low Culture, High Tech] society, and a technological espionage struggle ensues.

Throuthout the 19th Century, a secret British society researches the [Phlebotinum], Neutrinovoltaic power leading to increasing degrees of separation between Britain and the rest of the world, creating a [Decade Dissonance].

By the 20th Century, technological equilibrium is established with Britain replicating its IRL trade dominance benefiting Europe. The UK re-invents slipstream travel, with Albert Strand ultimately stranded on Elysion and trying to get home.

With Strand, we explore the perennial struggle of a society when its technological capabilities out-strips its morality. Most Americans do not understand the technology they use. Nor are they interested in its long-term implications. We also explore the tension between centralism/de-centralism, individualism, etc.
