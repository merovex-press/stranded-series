##### Summary

<!-- One-paragraph summary of the series from the character’s point-of-view. Setup, 8-segments, conclusion. -->

#### Backstory

<!-- Snowflake 5 - Character Backstory.

Take a few hours per character to explore their backstory and how it propels them forward. -->

##### Dark Moment Story.

<!-- This is a short story about a specific, reader-relevant event that happened that the character remembers and can tell in detail. It is not a traumatic event, but something that happened soon after that drove it home. It leads to understanding what he needs to heal his Flaw and obtain his Greatest Dream. If the author cannot feel for the character, then there’s a problem.
-->

Think _Butcher of Anderson Station_. Rough out a story about the character's past that gives them a flawed view of reality.

##### Happiest Moment Story.

<!-- What was the character’s happiest moment? This is the inverse of the Dark Moment Story. Just like the DMS. Also like the DMS, the character will feed this back to the reader in dialog. Have your character write this in the first person. What of this moment can we bring back to the character at the Denouement
 -->
*  Greatest Dream.
