Snowflake 3 - Character Summary. Take an hour and write a one-page summary sheet that tells
* one-sentence summary of character's storyline
* Secret Desire / Want / Motivation
* Nobel Quest / Goal (SMART)
* Epiphany, how the character changes
* one-paragraph summary of character's storyline

Snowflake 5 - Character Backstory. Take a few hours per character to explore their backstory and how it propels them forward.

Snowflake 7 - Character Details. Take several hours per character and drill deep into them by creating a character bible for each one. This is where you will save all the details about your characters.

### Character Name - Role

<!-- The sections (Summary, Backstory, Details) derive from Randy Ingermanson’s Snowflake advice.
* Backstory was derived from The Story Equation, by Susan May Warren. Basically, Ms. Warren’s advice lays right on top of Randy’s.

<!-- One-paragraph summary of the series from the character’s point-of-view. Setup, 8-segments, conclusion. -->

**Summary.**
: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

#### Backstory

**Identity.**
: Adjective + Noun character uses to self-identify at _status quo_.

**Worst Fear / External Conflict.**
: Something he thinks will happen again that creates the same pain as his dark moment

**Lie / Internal conflict.**
:  Something he thinks is true because of his dark moment, but just is not true (counters series theme)

**Wound.**
: Emotional repercussions from his dark moment that he will protect himself against

**Flaw.**
: The bad behavior expressing the Greatest Fear & Wound

**Secret Desire / Greatest Dream / Want.**
: This is a product of the DMS and character's Greatest Dream

**Noble Quest / Goal.**
: SMART goal

**Competing Value.**
: Alternative expression of Want that protects the Wound or Flaw rather than transforming it.

**Epiphany.**
: What he learns during the series

##### Dark Moment Story.

<!-- This is a short story about a specific, reader-relevant event that happened that the character remembers and can tell in detail. It is not a traumatic event, but something that happened soon after that drove it home. It leads to understanding what he needs to heal his Flaw and obtain his Greatest Dream. If the author cannot feel for the character, then there’s a problem.

Think _Butcher of Anderson Station_. Rough out a story about the character's past that gives them a flawed view of reality.

##### Happiest Moment Story.

<!-- What was the character’s happiest moment? This is the inverse of the Dark Moment Story. Just like the DMS. Also like the DMS, the character will feed this back to the reader in dialog. Have your character write this in the first person. What of this moment can we bring back to the character at the Denouement
