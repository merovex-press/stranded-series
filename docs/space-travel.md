# Space travel

## Spacecraft

**Design.** Spacecraft are symmetrically built around a frame. Propulsion is reaction-based, so a considerable amount of the ship's total mass is its consumable reaction material. Ships cannot travel in atmosphere as gravity will crush the frame. Travel between planet and orbitals is done through interface vehicles. **Ships are built like office towers** (Pringles cans), with small decks stacked on top of each other, which experience gravity only when the ship is under thrust.

**Travel.** When traveling, ships accelerate to the midpoint of their journey, turn around, and decelerate. No dogfights, no Immelmann or Crazy Ivan maneuvers. Safe travel means accelerating to a midpoint at 1.0-1.5 G, turn around, decelerate at 1.0-1.5 G, over a period of several days.

**Heat.** Heat is always a problem. An inability to dissipate heat can get one into trouble. Burn your engines too much, or fire too many lasers, and you start to have problems in combat yourself, because of an inability to radiate heat into the darkness of space.

**Payload.** These concerns combine to suggest that a ships payload section is relatively small (10-30% of the shipâ€™s mass), Given the limits on payload, space for crew, weapons, cargo, and extras is limited. Slipdrives are small to allow FTL travel within the design constraints (i.e. we wanted ships both with slipdrives and with guns), and so the limit on FTL travel comes from the point of departure, well above the ecliptic of the system.

* Civilian ships never travel at more than 1G (V-shift 3) for longer than a full day.
* Military ships never travel at more than 2G (V-shift 5) for longer than a full day.
