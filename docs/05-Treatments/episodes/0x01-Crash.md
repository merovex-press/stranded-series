## Season one

### Crash

Normally, a Pilot is 2x as long as the main. So, 180 minutes...36-40kwords.

Starts with him in an escape pod hurling toward the alien planet, fading into/out-of conscious. Echoing in his mind are the words "you promised" shrieked by his wife from when he told her in the parking lot he would not refuse the two-year assignment on the observation orbital.

... This is because his biggest regret is lying to her and going...that he has had a son he never met.
