## Neutrino Energy

* The neutrino is the source of abundant, clean, renewable energy.
* Neutrinovoltaic - a low voltage system of 12/24/48V DC
* **Neutrino Film** is "a film made of metal or a metal alloy, in particular a film made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a so-called neutrino or ntrino film (registered trademarks), to a method of production and to a use of a film made of metal or a metal alloy." [WO2016142056A1]
* **Neutrino Power Cubes** are highly sophisticated power cells that have the advantage of being able to supply energy in complete darkness. They do this by harnessing the kinetic energy created by invisible waves of cosmic radiation, transforming it into micro-vibrations in a complex resonation process facilitated by super-symmetrical coatings on a stable substrate. And because these power cells can be stacked on top of one another, they are more compact and efficient than todayâ€™s solar cells and far less easily damaged.
* **Neutrino Energy Harvesting** is when energy can be derived from many different sources such as radio waves, vibrations, heat, or light, and these sources can be either natural or artificial. Solar cells convert light; thermoelectric generators convert heat flux (temperature differences); and Neutrino Power Cubes convert vibrations caused by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos into electricity.
* Today is the era of "**homo electricus**," and electricity will continue to play an important role in mankind's never-ending strides towards further development.
