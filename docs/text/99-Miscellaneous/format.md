## Western Genre

Author and screenwriter Frank Gruber described seven plots for Westerns:[12][13]

1. **Union Pacific story.** The plot concerns construction of a railroad, a telegraph line, or some other type of modern technology or transportation. Wagon train stories fall into this category.
1. **Ranch story.** The plot concerns threats to the ranch from rustlers or large landowners attempting to force out the proper owners.
1. **Empire story.** The plot involves building a ranch empire or an oil empire from scratch, a classic rags-to-riches plot.
1. **Revenge story.** The plot often involves an elaborate chase and pursuit by a wronged individual, but it may also include elements of the classic mystery story.
1. **Cavalry and Indian story.** The plot revolves around "taming" the wilderness for white settlers.
1. **Outlaw story.** The outlaw gangs dominate the action.
1. **Marshal story.** The lawman and his challenges drive the plot.
