### Long form bio

<!-- Nebula and Hugo Award-winning author, Mary Robinette Kowal is a novelist and professional puppeteer. In 2008 she won the Astounding Award for Best New Writer and her debut novel Shades of Milk and Honey (Tor 2010) was nominated for the 2010 Nebula Award for Best Novel. In 2019, the first book in the Lady Astronaut series The Calculating Stars (Tor 2018), won the Hugo, Nebula and Locus awards, becoming one of only eighteen novels to do so. Her stories have appeared in Strange Horizons, Asimov’s, and several Year’s Best anthologies, as well as in her collection Scenting the Dark and Other Stories from Subterranean Press. Her short story collection Word Puppets was published in 2015, and includes both of her Hugo Award-winning stories in addition to fifteen others, running the full range of speculative fiction. In 2016, her World War I fantasy novel Ghost Talkers was published by Tor books, followed in 2018 by her alternate history Lady Astronaut series.

As of 2019, Kowal is the President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.

In 2011, after several appearances as a guest star on the podcast Writing Excuses, Kowal became a permanent member of the cast. In 2013, the seventh season of the podcast won the Hugo Award for Best Related Work. Her involvement in the podcast also contributed to the creation of the Shadows Beneath anthology, in which Kowal and her three co-hosts contributed short stories alongside materials charting the unique creative process of each author.

Kowal is also an award-winning puppeteer. In high school, she took up puppetry as a hobby, but as Kowal says, she “never thought of it as something you could get paid for.” Instead, she went to East Carolina University to pursue an art degree, minoring in theater and speech. While performing as Audrey II in a performance of Little Shop of Horrors, she learned that a professional puppeteer had come to the show. It was a turning point. Kowal went on to intern at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, GA. With over twenty years of experience, she has performed for LazyTown (CBS), the Center for Puppetry Arts, Jim Henson Pictures, Sesame Street, and founded Other Hand Productions. Her designs have garnered two UNIMA-USA Citations of Excellence, the highest award an American puppeteer can achieve.

Her career in puppetry consumed much of Kowal’s creative energy for over ten years. Although she wrote in high school and college, it wasn’t until her brother moved his family to China that she began writing again. Like Lewis Carroll and J.M. Barrie, she started creating children’s fantasy as a way to stay connected to her young niece and nephew. Reminded of how much she enjoyed writing, she began submitting short stories and made her first sale in 2005, and her first professional sale to Strange Horizons in 2006.

When she isn’t writing or puppeteering, Kowal brings her speech and theater background to her work as a voice actor. She is a member of SAG/AFTRA. She has recorded audio books and short stories for authors such as Seanan McGuire, Cory Doctorow and John Scalzi. She likes to describe voice acting as “puppetry, without the pain.” -->

Horatio Beech is the author of the Strand Series; a low fantasy, Type-X alternative-history series. The series follows generations of the Strand family after discovery of advanced technology during the French and Indian War. What would happen if America did not separate from England?

Horatio is a fond student of history. When he realized his high school World History teacher---a volley ball coach---was only reading the textbook, he would go to the library and do supplemental reading. He would then sharpshoot the teacher with questions in class that revealed that the textbook was the depth of the teacher's understanding. Through this exercise, however, he picked up a love for reading history. He was fond of saying a "History [Magnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_school)" high school would consist of better history teachers and a larger budget for movies.

His desire to write started in his teens, and waxed and waned through into his 40s. In high school, a chapter of a novel he started was accepted as a short story into the school's annual literary publication. He kept writing into college, but life got on the way and he dithered on whether to write. The desire never went away.

His professional career saps much of his creative energy. As a program manager supporting diverse government organizations, he finds plenty of opportunities to apply his fiction writing skills---especially during the annual performance review cycle.

When he isn't writing or working, Horatio plays simulations (the Civilization series), and a massively multiplayer online game (World of Tanks). In the 1980s, he started playing "Empire" on the Commodore 64, which morphed into Civilization with the addition of technology. He has played most versions, but sticks with Civilization V. He plays Civ like others play Solitaire.
World of Tanks has the excitement of a first-person shooter with built-in limitations based on the vehicles that gives an old man a fighting chance against kids.
Both games and program management have the same demand: the ability to track significant context, resilient planning, deep understanding of technical capabilities, and improvisation. Much like writing a novel series.
