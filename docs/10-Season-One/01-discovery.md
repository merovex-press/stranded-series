**Ephraim George Biggs** is a blacksmith and an extremist Son of Liberty who wants nothing more than American independence. His goal is to use the weapons he finds to purge America of British control, but is confronted with needing them to thwart Pontiac's Rebellion. He realizes protecting society is more important than his view of what that society should be.

Story: Ephraim killed a British officer and was found guilty, only to escape and flee to the edge of society seeking refuge with his brother. Jeffry refuses, but also gives him lead time to flee into the wilderness, where Ephraim is pursued by Indians and falls into the Temple. With advanced weapons in hand, he tries to get them to Sons of Liberty, only to be captured by Mortimer. When Pontiac's Rebellion is known, he relents to his brother's pressure to surrender the location of the temple (and take Mortimer & militia there) to get more weapons to lift the seige of Ft. Pitt. In compensation, Mortimer lets Ephraim free by agreeing to say he was killed in the fighting. Ephraim decides to go to South Carolina under an assumed name, but murders & robs Solomon Sharpe first.

**Jeffry Biggs** is Ephraim's Loyalist brother, who only wants to grow his legal business by moving to the edge of society. His goal is to be left alone and stay neutral, but is confronted with his brother's need for help. He realizes that he can be involved without taking sides, if only to save his brother.

Story: Jeff is a small-town lawyer who prefers the outskirts of society. He argues with his brother, but when Mortimer seeks to find Ephraim he choses to remain mute. When Ephraim is captured, Jeffry goes to defend him only to realize the sentence was already set (unfair!) and that all that remains is for Ephraim to be hanged. When Pontiac's seige of Ft. Pitt is known, he persuades Ephraim to surrender the weapons to the authorities on promise of clemency.

**Mortimer Reece** is a bounty-hunter who only wants to serve his country. His goal is to capture Ephraim Biggs and bring him to justice for an alleged murder and treason. He is confronted with Biggs' discovery of advanced weapons and Pontiac's Rebellion, and realizes that these advanced weapons are a godsend for the British.

Story: Mortimer is a bounty-hunter called to retrieve the fugitive Ephraim Biggs. He tracks Biggs to TOWN where the trail goes cold after Jeffry's refual to help. The trail picks up again when he hears from a Solomon that Biggs is in Philadelphia. He captures Biggs and gets into a squabble with Jeffry over Ephraim's (lack of) trial. When they hear of Pontiac's War, he agrees to lobby for Ephraim's freedom in exchange for the weapons, then the two join forces to lift the seige of Ft. Pitt.

**Warren Boydell** is a government customs agent and coordinator of British espionage in Philadelphia. He wants wealth and prestige for serving King & Country. His goal in the story is to coordinate the apprehension of Ephraim Biggs and quiet the Sons of Liberty. He is confronted by the fantastic weaponry and realizes this is his path to prestige.

Story: Warren Boydell is a government customs agent and coordinator of British espionage in Philadelphia. He sets Mortimer on his task and is frustrated when Mortimer turns up empty handed. He hears from his mole that Ephraim is in Philadelphia, and gets word to Mortimer to come get him (he holds back part of the reward to each man). He is amazed by the new weaponry and lantern, and sends them to London, which triggers the series.

**Solomon Sharpe** is a printer and mole within the Sons of Liberty in Philadelphia. He wants to earn enough money to go into business for himself. His goal is to collect the reward for turning in a known fugitive who is talking about fantastic weapons.

Story: Solomon Sharpe is works for a printer in Philadelphia and wants money to set up his own press. He finds out about Biggs' reward and collects his "30 pieces of silver" by ratting him out. He is later confronted by Ephraim who kills him in his home and takes the reward.

**David Strand** is an average citizen, tinkerer and blacksmith. He wants to be known for something. His goal is to serve as militiaman to lift the siege of Fort Pitt during Potomac's Rebellion. He is confronted with the complexity of the new weapon and realizes that helping reverse engineer them is his way to notoriety.

Story: Strand is a minor blacksmith who tinkers with various inventions. As part of the militia, he is called up to go lift the siege of Ft. Pitt. Given the fantastic rifle, he realizes this is his chance to become famous. He fights more like a sniper and is shocked by the loss of life. After the fighting, he persuades Boydell to let him and his brother Henry try to reverse-engineer the weapon.

**Kariwase** is a lead Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) warrior among the Iroquois. [@IroquoisMaleNames] He wants nothing more than to purge his homeland of white settlers. His goal in the story is to pave the way for Pontiac's siege of Fort Pitt by hunting solitary whites. He is confronted by Biggs' access to weaponry, and realizes that those advanced weapons could spell the doom for the Iroquois nation.

Story: Kariwase hunts white hunters who find themselves in Iroquois territory as part of the preliminary action of Pontiac's Rebellion. He prologs the series by killing a white savagely, eating brains per the start of the French & Indian War. He later hunts Biggs who evades him by falling into a pit. He leaves a small team to ensure Biggs doesn't escape, and is later enraged that they were killed by Biggs. He engages in counter-counter siege operations in a skirmish with the militia and is wounded & beaten off.

**Okwaho** is Kariwase's lieutenant, fiercely loyal. He wants to help Kariwase become a chief on day so as lieutenant he can enjoy the spoils. His goal in the story is to keep Kariwase safe, and is confronted when Kariwase wants to raid the large settlement to get the weapons? His epiphany is Kariwase's future value as a leader is in coping with the power shift brought on by the new weapons.

### Synopsis

**Prolog:** The Iroquois under KARIWASE capture & kill a trapper asleep in his camp, announcing the global threat.


**Act 1.** Ephraim George BIGGS is a rebel Son of Liberty on the run from HIM a UK bounty-hunter MORTIMER REECE. He shows up at his brother's house in the rain looking for refuge, but his brother (ever the lawyer) finds out why and sends him away (he repairs Jeffry's son's toy, showing him as a tinkerer). He goes to another town and gets hired as a smith who comments on his breeding, hands, and disrespect for civil authority.

**Act 2.** Excited by the prospects, Ephraim decides to take a few toys to Philadelphia to the Sons of Liberty. But, he first has to escape the Iroquois party.
He finds a way out of the Temple, but the pursuit resumes when he gives away his position. He shoots the hunting party killing the five of them in rapid succession. Rather than run, he loots the bodies for shoes and uses their arrows to conceal the wounds.
With a makeshift sled, he pulls out his samples and heads to Philadelphia, but he stops by his place in Smithytown, which alerts Mortimer that he is not dead.
Meanwhile, Kariwase discovers the slain warrior party and discovers the ruse, bewildered he tracks Mortimer's sled until he realizes it is leaving their territory.
Mortimer, alerted to Ephraim's return confronts the Smithy, but is thwarted somehow, and has his men resume searching neighboring towns while he goes back to Jeffry.
Ephraim arrives in Philadelphia and quietly makes himself known to the Sons. After a meal, he arranges a rural demonstration of the rifles, but SOLOMON SHARPE reports this to WARREN BOYDELL, who sends word to Mortimer.
Meanwhile, Kariwase meets with Pontiac and receives instructions related to the brewing war.
Mortimer meets with Jeffry and is flustered, accusing him of harboring a fugitive (and of being a coward by not challenging a duel), but when he gets back to his room in the Inn has word from Boydell of Ephraim's location. He hurries back to Philadelphia.
In Philadelphia, Boydell traps Ephraim by having Sharpe entertain Ephraim over dinner.
Meanwhile, Kariwase is involved in a battle fought before Ft. Pitt Siege.

**Act 3.**
<!-- He is bound for the noose when Pontiac's Rebellion induces him to surrender the mound's location. -->
In a cell (Research jails in Philadelphia circa 1770), Ephraim sends word to Jeffry asking for help.
Mortimer arrives in Philadelphia and after meeting with Sharp wants to find out about the weapon. They secure the rifle and test it, with Mortimer having a thumb incident.
Ephraim and Mortimer talk about the rifle, and Mortimer tries to get him drunk, only to learn that Ephraim has a high alcohol tolerance. They argue about British authority instead. "Your sentence will be carried out." "I've not been tried yet." "You were in absentia."
Meanwhile, Kariwase involved in another attack somewhere, and we find that he is up-and-coming and very anti-European.
Jeffry arrives in Philadelphia and tries to find a way to help his brother; finding out that Mortimer might let Ephraim free if the Temple's location was revealed. But, Ephraim refuses to help the British.
Meanwhile, news of Pontiac's raids reach Philadelphia, alerting to the need to take action. LOCAL COMMANDER realizes there are insufficient troops to protect the interior, when Boydell mentions the weapons.
This renews pressure to divulge the location, and when confronted about the facts (which he wants to doubt but for Jeffry's fear), Ephraim surrenders the weapon cache's location.

**Act 4.** <!-- The militia lifts the siege of Fort Pitt using the advanced weapons; news of which hits the Courts of Europe by storm. -->
Ephraim reacts to having given away the best thing for the Revolution when his brother cheers him up (story less). They start training on the weapons they have when they realize they do not have enough (4 rifles) or enough bullets (80). Mortimer heads to Pitt while Ephraim takes a small team to the Temple to get more, including the Strand brothers. He tries to take a route to obfuscate the temple's location. They get to the temple, no sign of trouble, get more weapons and bullets, and head to Pitt. Meanwhile, the Seige at Pitt intensifies. Mortimer and his men get into a fight with Kariwase, who is beaten back by the four rifles. Stunned & wounded, Kariwase heads to Pitt with Mortimer in pursuit. All arrive at Pitt and a fight ensues with two teams with rifles putting the indians into a cross-fire that kills most the indians. There is cleanup afterward and discussion about the rifles. Meanwhile, word gets to Boydell who sends a rifle, case of rounds and a lantern to London. Mortimer and Biggs talk, Biggs agreeing to disappear.
Mortimer & Boydell talk about the need to take what they have and break the Iroquois' back, when Johnson arrives to suggest negotiation. "How can you beat back an entire nation with 16 rifles and a box of bullets?"
Biggs arrives in Charleston, taking up work as a smith. He reviews a drawing what he remembered the rifle looking like.
The Strand brothers retrace their steps to the Temple; grab a bunch of tech and head to Philadelphia.
The technology reaches London, George "this changes everything."
