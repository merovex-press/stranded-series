With the exception of "guest posts" written by others (see the bottom of this page) and content of other authors duly credited, I own the content on this Web site. It is copyrighted in my name. I want to strike the appropriate balance between getting my content widely distributed while at the same time protecting my intellectual property rights. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

## Without My Permission

You are free to do the following without my permission:

   * Link to my site or any specific post on my site.
   * Extract and re-post less than 200 words on any other site, provided you link back to my original post.
   * Print off my posts and photocopy up to 50 copies for internal distribution within your own company or organization.
   * Print my posts in any non-commercial publication (e.g., company newsletter, church newsletter, class syllabus, etc.), provided you include the following copyright notice.

> “Copyright © {{ site.time | date: '%Y' }}, Benjamin C. Wilson. All rights reserved. Originally published at {{site.url}}.”

## Not Without My Permission

You must have my express written consent to do any of the following:

   * Use this content in for commercial purposes, including selling or licensing printed or digital versions of my content.
   * Alter, transform, or build upon this work.

## Re-Posting and Translation Rights

I do not permit the re-posting of my posts in their entirety. This is because Google penalizes websites for publishing duplicate content. It often can’t tell which site hosts the original, so I risk getting penalized myself for granting permission.

In addition, I don’t allow the translation and publication of my work in other languages. I simply don’t have the resources to validate the quality of the work.

## Guest Posts

Guest bloggers retain the copyright to the posts they write. The above permission guidelines do not apply to their work. If you are interested in re-posting or publishing their content, you must contact them directly. I cannot serve as a broker, agent, or contact point.

If you have some use for my content that is not covered here, please email me at [ben@merovex.com](mailto:ben@merovex.com?subject=Site%20Content%20Use).

## Registered Trademark

The Merovex mark and the Merovex logo (<img src="/assets/logo.svg" width="20px" height="20px" alt="">®) are registered trademarks owned by the site owner. Only Owner and its authorized licensees may use the Merovex Logo in advertising, promotional, and sales materials. When you are a licensee of this trademark, you: 1) may only use the mark to advertize Merovex, and include an attribution of my ownership of the trademark within the credit notice section of your publication.

When distributing inside the United States, include the registration symbol (®). When distributing outside the United States, do not include the registration mark, and use the phrase "is a trademark of Merovex, registered in the United States." This logo may not be used by other parties in marketing as this may create a perception that we endorse or sponsor the product, service or promotion.

## Image Credits

Throughout the site, largely in blog posts, I use various images made available by the original producer. With each image, I provide the image credit pointing to the creator, the site the image was made available on, and the license of the image when it was made available.

I rely on Creative Commons licensed images because of their irrevocability. See [CC licenses](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) for more information.

> Once you apply a CC license to your material, anyone who receives it may rely on that license for as long as the material is protected by copyright and similar rights, even if you later stop distributing it.
> <cite><a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Remember_the_license_may_not_be_revoked.">Creative Commons</a></cite>

As may be expected on the Internet, the original source and creator of some images will disappear over time. I try to leave the original link to expedite identification. However, if you are an owner of one of the images and want me to remove it, please email me at [ben@merovex.com](mailto:ben@merovex.com?subject=Image%20Credits). Despite the irrevocability, I will consider the request.
