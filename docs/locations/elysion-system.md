# Planets

## Elysol

Elysol is the parent star to the Elysion stellar system. It is a [Class K main-sequence star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-type_main-sequence_star) with a temperature of 4540K. It has a stellar mass of  0.9, a solar luminosity of 0.5, and solar radius of 0.86. It is more orange in color than the Sun. "Elysol" is a portmanteau of Elysion and Sol. It appears similar to Toliman (A-Cent B), but lack of a companion star leads scientists to conclude

## Moho

## Eve

It has one small moon: a captured asteroid called Gilly. It is especially notable for its extremely thick, dense atmosphere

## Elysia

Two moons.

## Duna

One moon.

## Dres


## Jool
