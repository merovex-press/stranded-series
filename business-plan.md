# Strand Series Business Plan

<!-- buisness-plan -->
The **Strand Series** provides bite-sized, high-volume, through-provoking entertainment to its target audience by releasing serial novellas as books & audiobooks.
Our audience are people who find themselves on the road for longer than a typical commute and want to pass the time.
We attract & engage with our audience through ads, blogging (written, video, audio), limited social media and newsletter.
We distribute through Amazon with a pricing structure that optimizes royalties without irritating our audience.

## Audience / Customer Segments

1. **White-collar travelers.** Some Strand readers commute, so they want to have short bursts of entertainment that fits in the time spent waiting in the airport or in the air.
2. **Super-Commuters.** Some Strand readers spend 2 hours a day on commuting. Like white-collar travelers, they are looking for entertainment that fits their travel time.
2. **Blue-collar truckers.** Some Strand readers are on the road for work. These are truckers who are looking for something to keep them from getting bored for longer periods.

## Value Proposition

Strand provides a fiction novella series to satisfy our customer segments' desire for entertainment, while being uplifting. Each novella should be short enough to fit in the time a reader / listener is either at the airport, in the air, or in the car. Novellas tie into seasons, which are long enough to fill a long-hauler's driving week.

## Approach / Business Model

Our Author business model is solo-developed high-volume fiction. We seek to put out a new 10-book season every two years to start. In a perfect world, a new season would launch every year.
