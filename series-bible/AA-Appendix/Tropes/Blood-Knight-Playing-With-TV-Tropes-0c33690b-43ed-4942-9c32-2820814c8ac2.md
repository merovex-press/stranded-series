**Basic Trope**: Someone who enjoys fighting.

- **Straight**: Bob loves a good fight and picks a profession that allows him to seek out worthy opponents and enjoys proving his skills against them in battle.
- **Exaggerated**:
    - Bob cannot go a week without getting into some kind of fight just to alleviate boredom if nothing else.
    - Bob starts a religion where brutally murdering your enemy is the best way for his salvation. And for the salvation of his enemies. Or Bob uses elements of "sacred sexuality" like in Tantrism, but replaces everything sexual with the joy of killing his enemies.
- **Downplayed**: Bob enjoys fighting against skilled opponents, but doesn't go out of his way to seek them out.
- **Justified**:
    - As a member of a militaristic culture that glorified warfare and prowess of the battlefield, Bob is merely acting according to his culture's expectations of a good warrior.
    - He started out his [rampage as a revenge](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge), but in the end, he ended up obsessed with fighting.
    - He spills the others' blood [to ease his thirst](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent). And since nutrition is a pleasure on itself...
    - Combat provides a *massive* adrenaline rush. Bob fights to get the ultimate high.
- **Subverted**: Bob enjoys proving his skill on the battlefield until he meets an opponent that grossly outclasses him in terms of skill. He then finds that fighting is less fun when you're getting your ass kicked.
- **Double Subverted**: Bob's beatdown motivates him to train harder so he can defeat his opponent.
- **Parodied**: Everytime Bob hears about a fight, he immediately goes berserk and runs at the place to start yelling "KILLBURNKILL!!!" and swinging the first heavy object he found and picked up left and right.
- **Zig Zagged**: Whether or not Bob is enjoying a fight depends on a variety of factors, sometimes he's having the time of his life, other times he's just as stressed as everyone else.
- **Averted**: Bob may be a warrior, but he doesn't enjoy fighting in the slightest
- **Enforced**:
    - The writer wants to portray the negative aspects of being obsessed with violence.
    - The writer finds "he goes looking for fights" more realistic as a plot device than "[all the fights come to him](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightMagnet)".
- **Implied**: Whenever Bob is in open combat, he seems much more relaxed than in everyday situations.
- **Lampshaded**:
    - "It's been like four days since anybody needed me to punch them. [I. Am. So. BORED.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis)"
    - "Doesn't he have another fun in his life?"
- **Invoked**: Bob was [raised from birth](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb) to love fighting and violence so that he could serve as [The Heavy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy) for the local [Big Bad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad).
- **Exploited**: Bob is easy to manipulate, because his love of fighting gets in the way of his critical thinking when it comes to things like "Should I be fighting this guy in the first place?"
- **Defied**: Bob isn't hesitant about fighting when it's necessary, but refuses to let it become something he enjoys for its own sake.
- **Discussed**: "If there's anything I've learned, [Enyo](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl), it's that if you show yourself to be strong, you'll have people lining up to fight. Thus, I want everyone to know how strong you are, so I can find a few combat-addicts to help further defend my plans."
- **Conversed**: "People who like fighting are always written as battle-lusty maniacs â€” as in, literally, they all but cum in battle, and in an X-rated show they go *that* far, too. It's always like that. You'd think writers would give them a bit more nuance nowadays."
- **Deconstructed**:
    - Bob's tendencies to seek out worthy opponents leads to him getting killed.
    - Bob's love of battle leads him to escalate a situation that could have easily been defused peacefully. He is abandoned by his comrades after the destruction his actions indirectly caused.
    - The person he fights for publically begs him to stop fighting.
- **Reconstructed**:
    - Bob knows his aggressive tendencies put him at risk of doing something stupid, so he emphasizes self-control and learns to enjoy his moments of delayed gratification.
    - Bob is a [Martial Pacifist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist) who deeply enjoys fighting, but also knows that there is a time and place for it.
    - In the end, Bob loses everything, he gets ostracised by everyone he wanted to defend, gets betrayed and outright killed. Hundred years later, even his enemies consider him a hero because he fought for what he believed, no matter the cost, and risked everything for his values.
- **Played For Laughs**: Bob treats fighting like any other form of entertainment. When everyone goes to the cinema, he goes to the boxing club, and going to war is his idea of a perfect vacation.
- **Played For Drama**:
    - Bob can seldom find any enjoyment in anything other than combat. Despite having been injured multiple times and being ridden by guilt over the times he had to kill someone, he continues to do the only thing that, in his opinion, makes his life worth living.
    - Bob is a [Death Seeker](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker) [who can't commit suicide](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICannotSelfTerminate) because it would be [dishonorable](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy). Therefore he tries to find [someone who can kill him in a fight](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop).
- **Played For Horror**: Bob is shown laughing with joy, while his fallen enemies scream in pain at his feet.
