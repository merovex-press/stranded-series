### Hobbes Was Right

*"The people, they know where I stand. They need rules to live by—I provide them. They break the rules, I break them. That's the way it works. Rights? Sure, I'm all for rights. But not at the expense of order."*

The only forces capable of controlling this setting are tyrants, dictators and authoritarian groups. Any attempt at democracy is [a doomed enterprise](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad), formulated by [Wide-Eyed Idealists](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist) working under the belief that there is a grain of selflessness in *any* person.

That this be a *benevolent* dictatorship [is optional](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar) (in fact, the presence of a benevolent dictator would suggest Hobbes was *wrong*).

Named after Thomas Hobbes, who wrote in the 17th-century book *Leviathan* that strong, centralized government is necessary to protect mankind from its own base nature and self-serving desires. The trope is based on a [Flanderized](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) version of his philosophy. It is worth noting that many medieval kings (as an isolated example) had to be strong and bastardly to be effective. Naturally, this opinion goes hand in hand with the belief that [Humans Are Bastards](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards), possibly [Humans Are Morons](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreMorons) if the arguments are about the reliability of human judgment if power is left in the hands of the many (though when one considers who the only available candidates for rulership are—[namely, members of that same species of bastard morons](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke)…). Indeed, Rousseau—the chief defender of the contrary position—had some choice words for Hobbes (although Hobbes, being dead, couldn't appreciate the insults).

Contrast [Machiavelli Was Wrong](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachiavelliWasWrong) and [Rousseau Was Right](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight); compare and contrast [The Extremist Was Right](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight), [The Evils of Free Will](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill), [Realpolitik](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik) and [Utopia Justifies the Means](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans). Has nothing to do with *[Calvin and Hobbes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes)*, though *that* Hobbes was named after this one.
