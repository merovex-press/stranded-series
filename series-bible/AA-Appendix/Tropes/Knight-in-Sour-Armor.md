### Knight in Sour Armor

When life gives you lemons...note

The world is filled with [Wide Eyed Idealists][8qlXdrXV] who believe in truth and justice and devote their lives to fighting for it. And then the [dark, cruel and brutal world][HgZAHQwy] keeps letting them down. For them, [Being Good Sucks][dV0aRfOr]. But rather than giving up on their goals, they choose to fight not because they believe they will truly make a difference, but because it's the right thing to do.

More often than not these characters are in settings that feature [Black and Gray Morality][BZ8YPyYo]. They're usually [survivors][F1JC6UKc] who have largely given up on believing in [Honor Before Reason][zftkt4Cy], but still strive to be [Lawful Good][f5mIyKpa] or as close to it as reality allows them to be. They are willing to bend the rules to save them. In [Lighter and Softer][S2sd1dfx] settings, these characters are [Grumpy Bears][a5wv40EX] and are often mocked by the other characters for being so sour all the time.

The presence of cynicism usually makes the [idealistic behavior even more noteworthy][hbNCMm5g]: it's easy to [love everyone][5RC1DOhN] when [Rousseau Was Right][m4QP5DTD], but you really have to be a good guy to believe that [Humans Are Bastards][X2OujTPk] and care about them anyway. Such characters can also be [The Fettered][oB6Qv0O1]; their cynical outlook tells them they could probably get away with all kinds of things that they don't do because [that would be wrong][YiWekhmg], and just because the world sucks doesn't mean you need to make it worse. Then again, this kind of character goes great with a world where you [Earn Your Happy Ending][g7geU5za] after much strife.

This is the inverse of the worldview of most [Well Intentioned Extremists][uNobssij], especially those who believe that [Utopia Justifies the Means][ZlNsbTKF]. Extremists or [Knight Templars][LBLA1LAs] may *believe* themselves to be this, but their actions are far too extreme. A Knight In Sour Armor believes in the rules and breaks them only when absolutely necessary, which is very rarely; not surprisingly, many have taken a [Heroic Vow][zKfqKOhU] related to this behavior. Often has a personal set of rules, trimmed down to those that really *matter* in order to minimize conflicts and distractions. Contributes to the Knight's gruff tendencies, since politeness tends to appear a lot further down the priority list than feeding orphans and so on.

Generally, these characters fit one of two personality types. Members of the first type are former [Wide Eyed Idealists][8qlXdrXV] who have come to [accept][oqMjL1xW] that their world is on the low end of the [Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism][vUa4vRV3], but who [still find something beautiful in their former ideals][hbNCMm5g] that they want to hold on to. Those of the second type are born cynics, who would make natural [Jerkass][2divM9bt] [antiheroes][vxmPUXur], but who nevertheless have devoted themselves to a code of honor or fair play. In either case, these people tend to have gone through (often painful) [Character Development][K894pePb] in their past, meaning that they are normally older than the average hero.

Either way, however, the effect is basically the same: you have a [Knight in Shining Armor][WIcvpSWM] wearing [Jade-Colored Glasses][oqMjL1xW]; the difference between the first and second types is which comes first.

These characters show up often in [Film Noir][fXmH1ST4], [Dark Fantasy][TnijeCWW], and [Low Fantasy][0sYzfdfX]. Law enforcement is a particularly attractive career, but the Knight in Sour Armor will usually hold back from becoming a [Cowboy Cop][nx27V3sG]. Very frequently, they end up as [The Mentor][lLEUEl8N], a [Grumpy Bear][a5wv40EX] with [Jade-Colored Glasses][oqMjL1xW], [The Last DJ][sYp83NmF], or a [Cool Old Guy][HQBcDNzo] if they last long enough. As teammates, they are often the [Sour Supporter][claGLKPs]. They also frequently end up as [Hero Antagonists][IHFoMqvc] and extreme [Woobies][qYnrrcMR]. This is often the final state of [The Atoner][Nq5flFlZ] post-[Heel–Face Turn][4B6daVlk]. Despite their cynicism, they behave like [The Anti-Nihilist][9n5Fx4uu].

Will often overlap with [The Snark Knight][UzouGqDL]. Compare [Angst? What Angst?][jsb8QcVT], for characters who take the [troubles of a good alignment][dV0aRfOr] with far less complaint; [Noble Demon][Rir5C6LI], who will [proudly declare themselves evil][pCoZZ6GI], but still finds themselves doing good once in a while; [Sour Outside, Sad Inside][KASXPX9J], for characters who sour attitude hides the fact they're sad; and [Jerkass Woobie][ZpecAgEQ], who spits in the face of the [alignment][IqutvgvQ] chart. Converted [Silly Rabbit, Idealism Is for Kids!][ViqwaLip] or [Good Is Old-Fashioned][q4RZfAog] believers may well find themselves becoming this trope if the heroes can bring them around. If they don't like idealism, but don't like cynicism, either, then you also have a touch of [Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers!][nBuyD2KU]

#### Knight in Sour Armor / Playing With

**Basic Trope**: A cynical character who is nevertheless [obstinately good][HAdZYHjX].

- **Straight**: Alice [Lime][h2Gj56UI] is an experienced police detective who honestly expects most of her cases to end [in tragedy][y1AhbVbG]... [but not for lack of trying][hM1P6s0q].
- **Exaggerated**: Alice is an [Iron Woobie][eVXthZl3] who is constantly undermined by those around her.
- **Justified**:
    - As a cop Alice has witnessed [Police Brutality][iV7lWYSa] and racial profiling, dealt with scumbag murderers and rapists, and on top that people hate her and assume she's a [Corrupt Cop][Y4WzIwXu] just because she's a cop.
    - Alice might think she lives in a [Crapsack World][HgZAHQwy], but also thinks that being [Good Feels Good][9Wyhkh7Q] even though it might [suck][dV0aRfOr] from time to time.
    - Alice might be cynical and think things will turn out for the worst, but she knows that there's still a chance that she's wrong and something good might happen.
    - Alice isn't fond of the state of the world, but that's all the more reason not to take it lying down, even if nobody else gives a shit.
- **Inverted**: Alice is an up-and-running villain filled with idealistic zeal of how easily she's going to [Take Over the World][2Y1WKwIb].
- **Double Subverted**:
    - ...and so is [everyone else][ePb4Qdur]. It's more suspicious if you *aren't*. Alice's bribes are voluntary payments from people grateful she actually did her job.
- **Zig Zagged**: The framing was actually a lie fabricated by Alice in order to hide her [True Colors][wVx1Urh1]. Which, in itself, was a lie to preserve her cover.
- **Averted**:
    - Alice is heroic, cheerful and optimistic.
    - Alice is cynical and doesn't bother to fight on.
- **Lampshaded**: "Why do you fight so hard if you know you're just going to lose?" "Things are bad enough already. I'm not letting them get worse."
- **Exploited**: Alice is assigned the case because the criminals are more likely to [mistake her for someone who can be bribed][JqmDP8vu].
- **Defied**: Whenever depression threatens, Alice remembers all the cases she closed successfully.
- **Discussed**: "Let me tell you right now — I would rather have Det. Lime investigating my murder than any wet-behind-the-ears [Wide-Eyed Idealist][8qlXdrXV] who thinks every criminal is always caught."
- **Conversed**: "You know, for a character as cynical as Det. Lime, she seems to be awfully heroic."
- **Deconstructed**:
    - Alternatively, she continues to protect a [Crapsack World][HgZAHQwy], not because it's the right thing to do, but because she's a [Blood Knight][okZ0VNnE] who thrives on conflict.
    - Alice's cynicism drives more idealistic folk away from her due to being [excessively bitter][oqMjL1xW] whilst other cynics scorn her for futilely trying to help people.
- **Reconstructed**: While she enjoys the warm fuzzies from fighting the good fight, she still goes into every case without expectations.
- **Played For Drama**: Alice gets her ideas thrown back in her face by a [Knight Templar][LBLA1LAs] or [Fallen Hero][mtmzpmft] who shares the same cynical beliefs as she does, forcing her to confront her own ideas and see how her attitude could create the same problems she despises.
- **Implied**: Alice goes into a rant about how the world is a [Crapsack World][HgZAHQwy]. When someone asks her why she fights, Alice gives them a meaningful look, but we don't see what she said.

The [Knight In Sour Armor][c2tY4vKt] is over here, ya goof... why do I even bother sometimes (mutter mutter)...

I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone. It's not because it's fun. God knows it's not because it's easy. It's not even because it works because it hardly ever does. I do what I do because it's right! Because it's decent! And above all, it's kind! It's just that... Just kind. If I run away today, good people will die. If I stand and fight, some of them might live. Maybe not many, maybe not for long. Hey, you know, maybe there's no point to any of this at all. But it's the best I can do. So I'm going to do it. And I'm going to stand here doing it until it kills me. And you're going to die too! Some day... And how will that be? Have you thought about it? What would you die for? Who I am is where I stand. Where I stand is where I fall. Stand with me. These people are terrified. Maybe we can help a little. Why not, just at the end, just be kind?"
> — The Twelfth Doctor, "The Doctor Falls"

> "I don't know any of you. But that doesn't matter, does it? My family: the family you demonized and excommunicated, has fought and died through generations for this country. We do this thing... for Wallachia, and her people. We don't have to know you all. We do it anyway. And it's not the dying that frightens us; it's never having stood up and fought for you. I'm Trevor Belmont. Of the House of Belmont. And dying... has never frightened me."
