### Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness

*"The fun, and the material for this article, lies in treating the whole thing as a game. I've been playing the game since I was a child, so the rules must be quite simple. They are: for the reader of a science-fiction story, they consist of finding as many as possible of the author's statements or implications which conflict with the facts as science currently understands them. For the author, the rule is to make as few such slips as he possibly can."*

[Speculative Fiction][mwMx33wj] fanatics are always raving about how "hard" the science is in various stories — but it's not like you can rub *a story* with a piece of quartz and see if it leaves a scratch on *the plot*. So what is "hardness" in SF? Why do some people want it? And [how do we put a number to it][NOkAqidf]?

Beginning with the first question: "Hard" [Science Fiction][sgdWS6mo] is firmly grounded in reality, with only a few fantastic flights of fancy not justified by science, or with the technology being nonexistent in today's world but probably scientifically possible at some point. "Soft" [Sci-Fi][LXajJBEF] is more flexible on the rules. Even the fantastical aspects of the story will show a divide — in hard SF, they operate through strict, preferably physical, laws, where in soft SF they work in whatever way suits the story best. What this leads to for hard SF is a raised bar for the amount of scientific research the writer must put into the story, and usually [this is shown quite clearly][8HrNu5Wn].

Example: a character is shown a time machine and asks, "How does it work?"

- **In soft SF:** "You sit in this seat, set the date you want, and pull that lever."
- **In hard SF:** "A good question with an interesting answer. [Please have a seat while I bring you up to speed][8iQ04sci] on the latest ideas in quantum theory, after which I will spend a chapter detailing an elaborate, yet plausible-sounding connection between quantum states, the unified field theory, and the means by which the brain stores memory, all tied into theories from both [Albert Einstein][3qaD956S] [and][dfsz3JLW] [Stephen Hawking][LDQ3wJFW]."
- **In really hard SF:** "It doesn't. Time travel to the past is impossible."

Unfortunately for analytical purposes, this pattern is not universal - hard SF stories can skip over the details as long as the basic explanation is correct [given what's been established so far][j1PwGhT3]. Therefore, regardless of the [typical stylistic flourishes][Ucn7wU8t] ("If all stories were written like science fiction stories" by Mark Rosenfelder, a [conlanger][JF4OIW6e]) of hard SF, the only way to define it is self-consistency and scientific accuracy.

Which leads us to the Scale.

#### 1. [Science in Genre Only][IWwAmgHC]

The work is unambiguously set in the *literary genre* of [Science Fiction][sgdWS6mo], but *scientific* it is not. [Applied Phlebotinum][Tr5Te8RN] is the rule of the day, often of the [Nonsensoleum][xTPfjVyz] kind, [Green Rocks][MHJRQ0qR] gain [New Powers as the Plot Demands][pmKfr4nv], and both [Bellisario's Maxim][0Zf3RquH] and the [MST3K Mantra][PuIc3GLg] apply. Works like *[Futurama][0ABzsOm6]*, *[Star Wars][gMEIAaq9]*, *[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann][G7CIHgW1]*, The [DC][jIFoUr2L] and [Marvel][Ug9gAKAB] universes, and *[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy][fIoWDzmF]* fall in this class.

#### 2. [World of Phlebotinum][ZitMy4xA]

The universe is full of [Applied Phlebotinum][Tr5Te8RN] with more to be found behind every star, but the Phlebotinum is dealt with in a [fairly consistent fashion despite its lack of correspondence with reality][j1PwGhT3] and, in-world, is considered to lie within the realm of scientific inquiry. Works like [E. E. “Doc” Smith][4bS5N9zc]'s *[Lensman][Ye3kacUV]* series, *[Neon Genesis Evangelion][uNkklZWO]*, *[Star Trek: The Original Series][cQ3sVlht]*, and *[StarCraft][BQi0XVUl]* fall in this category. A subclass of this class (arguably 2.5 on the scale) contains stories that are generally sound, except the physics aren't our own. Plot aside, they are often a philosophical exploration of a concept [no longer considered true][FxcUSmAI] (such as [Aristotelian physics][IXqHfdLt]), or never considered true in the first place (e.g. two spatial dimensions instead of three, like *[Flatland][QA9xuupk]*). Some of [Arthur C. Clarke][LuigRHmY]'s stories fall here. However, given [the overlap with fantasy][yV3kzfoj], it can [prove tricky][2u7p0y5r] to even classify a story as SF.

#### 3. [Physics Plus][xhoAtoth]

Stories in this class once again have multiple forms of [Applied Phlebotinum][Tr5Te8RN], but in contrast to the prior class, the author aims to justify these creations with [real][8HrNu5Wn] and [invented][T1W79pRq] natural laws — and these creations and others from the same laws will [turn up again and again in new contexts][sfG5JATf]. Works like *[Schlock Mercenary][tLhDCzX3]*, [David Weber][26IsXwtN]'s *[Honor Harrington][0acypL0W]* series, David Brin's *[Uplift][tckHMq15]* series, and *[Battlestar Galactica (2003)][33D2GErh]* fall in this class. Most [Real Robot][lSpdYpyW] shows fall somewhere between Classes 2 and 3.

#### 4. [One Big Lie][11K1XHYU]

Authors of works in this class invent one (or, at most, a very few) counterfactual physical laws and writes a story that explores the implications of these principles. James Blish's *[Cities in Flight][kORNsz1m]* stories fall squarely into this category, courtesy of the "Dirac Equations" leading to the "spindizzy motor" and instantaneous communication. Most works in [Alan Dean Foster][ZPlP4YWe]'s *[Humanx Commonwealth][zgYlUwag]* series, the Ad Astra board games and [Robert A. Heinlein][cRNC2Ulg]'s *[Farnham's Freehold][mQxkQBuo]* fall in this category, as do many of [Vernor Vinge][Z5at8M5n]'s books. This class also includes a subclass (4.5 on the scale) we call *One Small Fib*, containing stories that include only a single counterfactual device (often [FTL Travel][RY9uZfJ6]), but for which the device is not a major element of the plot. Many [Hal Clement][zZhSFO0c] novels (e.g. *[Mission of Gravity][f3I5yyS7]*, *Close to Critical*) and *[Freefall][yYcu3X3p]* fall within the subclass.

* The _Rocketeer_ similarly goes on a jet pack whose exhaust is cool enough that it doesn't roast the wearer but has enough thrust to launch them in the air. One of the realistic implications is that in order to control the flight, one needs a rudder (in the form of a helmet), something Howard Hughes couldn't figure out.
* The _Terminator_ has the Big Lie of the Time Displacement Equipment which allows the Time Travel story to take place. Apart from that, the biggest stretches of plausibility are the "living skin" worn by the Terminator and the "plasma weapons" seen in the brief flashes of the future. Everything else seems to be a reasonable extrapolation of contemporary technology. For instance, the Terminator is armored with an advanced metal alloy that makes it effectively Immune to Bullets, but it can be still be damaged by things like explosives or getting run over by a semi truck. Later entries in the franchise get considerably softer, with things like shapeshifting robots made out of "liquid metal," Nano Machines that can be used to remotely hack technological devices, and complicated time travel storylines.
* The first _Back to the Future_ movie has the flux capacitor (which makes time travel possible) as its sole science-fiction element, with everything else being grounded in the reality . . . until the Sequel Hook at the end shows us a flying car and a portable cold-fusion reactor. Back to the Future II features much softer and more plentiful science-fiction during the trip to 2015, though the third movie in the trilogy mostly brings things back to about the same level as the first movie.
Inception posits what would happen if humans could use technology to construct, control and enter each others' dreams. The entire plot comes from that sole technology, although The Rules of dream-traveling are mostly Rule of Symbolism.

#### 5. [Speculative Science][RyMR1kcA]

Stories in which there is no "big lie" — the science of the tale is (or [was][FxcUSmAI]) genuine speculative science or engineering, and the goal of the author to make as few errors with respect to known fact as possible. The first two books in [Robert L. Forward][Z8Pbpsnw]'s *Rocheworld* series and [Robert A. Heinlein][cRNC2Ulg]'s *[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress][wJFvPxb6]* fall in this class. A subclass of this (5.5 on the scale) is *Futurology:* stories which function almost like a prediction of the future, extrapolating from current technology rather than inventing major new technologies or discoveries. (Naturally, [Zeerust][7FovX6em] is common in older entries.) *[Gattaca][FyEVsPqa]*, *[Planetes][I8jG2OnX]*, *[Transhuman Space][v2Qt2MMA]* and the more [Speculative Fiction][mwMx33wj] works of [Jules Verne][hMEAMp1L] fall in this subclass.

#### 6. [Real Life][6gaGmntY] (aka Fiction in Genre Only)

A [Shared Universe][23KUZ3Pv] which spawned its own genre, known as "[Non-Fiction][FrHPeAI5]". Despite the various problems noted at [Reality Is Unrealistic][KHrsZjF1], it is almost universally agreed that there is no other universe known so thoroughly worked out from established scientific principles. [The Apollo Program][R8dvY1Hk], [World War II][wKkRPoT0], [and][so6WtNCv] [Woodstock][koLeSr2p] fall in this class.
