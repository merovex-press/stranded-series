### Power (Engines, Electricity & Locomotion)

Engine development was slower as it derived from patent research. Dates below indicate when they were commercially available.

* 1820 - Electricity using hydropower. Biomass generators commercially available by 1839
* 1826 - Oil discovered, knock 20 years off of evolution of oil
* 1828 - Diesel engine (called the biomass engine)
* **1836 - JL Chandler reverse engineered neutrino power, receiving a patent on the Chandler Power Cubes. (15 June)**
* 1836 - Gasoline engine - limited use to highly urban environments due to poor infrastructure and lack of access to gas.
* 1839 - Diesel locomotive - Slow and mechanically inefficient
* **1842 - First Neutrinovoltaic powered (NVP) locomotive using the MicroChandler Power Cube.**
* 1845 - Gasoline automobile limited utility in favor of biomass trucks.
* **1845 - Chandler died (29 December), Chandler's patent on the CPCs lapses in 1846.**
* **1859 - First Neutrinovoltaic powered (NVP) automobile by Tucker. [See real timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_electric_vehicle#Electric_model_cars)**
* 1861 - Latimer Clark and Sir Charles Bright coined the name "volt" for the unit of resistance. **This countered the growing interest in naming it the "Chand" or "Chandle" as part of the resistance to Toltec influences. The term was in widespread use by 1869.**
* **1869 - NVP "Victoria" Taxies introduced by Walter C. Bersey** (10y early, see Images)
* **1888 - NVP oceangoing ships**  (Oil-burning naval ships)

#### Chandler Neutrino Power Cube

**Johnathan Link Chandler** was the first to reverse engineer the Toltec Neutrino Engine (called Annichites by the Toltec), creating the Chandler Neutrino Power Cell, and Power Cubes. The NVPC (Neutrino-voltaic Power Cube) is a 2.25" cube. Chandler encased them in a thin layer of white porcelain with four brass electrodes flush with the body. This allows the cubes to be tethered to create the larger power cubes.

|   225t. CPC  | 104  |  1.1M |  20' |  225t |   28MW | 37500 HP |

The Domestic CPC is the standard accessory of modern English domesticity (1914) at 3.1 kilowatts.

1 HP = 750 Watts

* HMS Dreadnought 23,000 shp ( 17,000 kW) - three  60t CPCs
* Iowa class     242,000 shp (158,000 kW) - seven 225t CPCs
* Titanic 46,000 horsepower - five 60t CPCs

[Historic HMS Dreadnought used 17MW propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Dreadnought_(1906)). The HMS Dreadnought was launched with three 60-ton CPCs. The Titanic used five 60-ton CPCs.

When humanity found the Toltec orbitals, they saw just how closely Chandler's design worked, with a single 225-ton CPC.


#### Neutrino Energy

* The neutrino is the source of abundant, clean, renewable energy.
* Neutrinovoltaic - a low voltage system of 12/24/48V DC
* **Neutrino Film** is "a film made of metal or a metal alloy, in particular a film made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a so-called neutrino or ntrino film (registered trademarks), to a method of production and to a use of a film made of metal or a metal alloy." [WO2016142056A1]
* **Neutrino Power Cubes** are highly sophisticated power cells that have the advantage of being able to supply energy in complete darkness. They do this by harnessing the kinetic energy created by invisible waves of cosmic radiation, transforming it into micro-vibrations in a complex resonation process facilitated by super-symmetrical coatings on a stable substrate. And because these power cells can be stacked on top of one another, they are more compact and efficient than todayâ€™s solar cells and far less easily damaged.
* **Neutrino Energy Harvesting** is when energy can be derived from many different sources such as radio waves, vibrations, heat, or light, and these sources can be either natural or artificial. Solar cells convert light; thermoelectric generators convert heat flux (temperature differences); and Neutrino Power Cubes convert vibrations caused by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos into electricity.
* Today is the era of "**homo electricus**," and electricity will continue to play an important role in mankind's never-ending strides towards further development.
