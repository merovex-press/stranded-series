### Chandler Neutrino Power Cube

**Johnathan Link Chandler** was the first to reverse engineer the Toltec Neutrino Engine, creating the Chandler Neutrino Power Cell, and Power Cubes. The NVPC (Neutrino-voltaic Power Cube) is a 2.25" cube. Chandler encased them in a thin layer of white porcelain with four brass electrodes flush with the body. This allows the cubes to be tethered to create the larger power cubes.

The Domestic CPC is the standard accessory of modern English domesticity (1914).

The 1-Stone power cube was enough to power late 19C destroyers. The HMS Dreadnought was launched with a 20-Stone cube. The Titanic would have likewise used the 20S Cube.

When humanity found the Toltec orbitals, they saw just how closely Chandler's design worked, with 160-Stone cubes. The Toltec called them Annichites.
