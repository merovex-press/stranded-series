### Power (Engines, Electricity & Locomotion)

Engine development was slower as it derived from patent research. Dates below indicate when they were commercially available.

* 1820 - Electricity using hydropower. Biomass generators commercially available by 1839
* 1826 - Oil discovered, knock 20 years off of evolution of oil
* 1828 - Diesel engine (called the biomass engine)
* **1836 - JL Chandler reverse engineered neutrino power, receiving a patent on the Chandler Power Cubes. (15 June)**
* 1836 - Gasoline engine - limited use to highly urban environments due to poor infrastructure and lack of access to gas.
* 1839 - Diesel locomotive - Slow and mechanically inefficient
* **1842 - First Neutrinovoltaic powered (NVP) locomotive using the MicroChandler Power Cube.**
* 1845 - Gasoline automobile limited utility in favor of biomass trucks.
* **1845 - Chandler died (29 December), Chandler's patent on the CPCs lapses in 1846.**
* **1859 - First Neutrinovoltaic powered (NVP) automobile by Tucker. [See real timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_electric_vehicle#Electric_model_cars)**
* 1861 - Latimer Clark and Sir Charles Bright coined the name "volt" for the unit of resistance. **This countered the growing interest in naming it the "Chand" or "Chandle" as part of the resistance to Toltec influences. The term was in widespread use by 1869.**
* **1869 - NVP "Victoria" Taxies introduced by Walter C. Bersey** (10y early, see Images)
* **1888 - NVP oceangoing ships**  (Oil-burning naval ships)

### Chandler Neutrino Power Cube

**Johnathan Link Chandler** was the first to reverse engineer the Toltec Neutrino Engine, creating the Chandler Neutrino Power Cell, and Power Cubes. The NVPC (Neutrino-voltaic Power Cube) is a 2.25" cube. Chandler encased them in a thin layer of white porcelain with four brass electrodes flush with the body. This allows the cubes to be tethered to create the larger power cubes.

| Name | Use | Size | # | Volume | Weight | Power |
| ---- | --- | ---- |--- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Neutrino Power Cell | Car | 1x1x1 | 1 | 2 1/4" | 9oz each | 122 Watt |
| Domestic Chandler Power Cube | House | 2x2x2  | 8 | 5"  | 4#-8oz  | 976Watt  |
| 1-Stone Chandler Power Cube | Ship | 3x3x3 | 27 | 6 3/4" | 15# 3oz | 3.3KW |
| 5-Stone Chandler Power Cube | Factories | 5x5x5 | 125 | 11-1/4" | 70# | 15.2KW |
| 20-Stone Chandler Power Cube | Battleship | 8x8x8 | 512 | 18"x18"x18" | 288# | 39KW |
| 160-Stone Chandler Power Cube | Orbital | 16x16x16 | 4096 | 1 yard cubed | 2304# or 1t. | 500KW |

The Domestic CPC is the standard accessory of modern English domesticity (1914).

The 1-Stone power cube was enough to power late 19C destroyers. The HMS Dreadnought was launched with a 20-Stone cube. The Titanic would have likewise used the 20S Cube.

When humanity found the Toltec orbitals, they saw just how closely Chandler's design worked, with 160-Stone cubes. The Toltec called them Annichites.
