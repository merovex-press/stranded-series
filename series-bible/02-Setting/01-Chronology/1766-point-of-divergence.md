### 1763-1776: Point of Divergence

The Seven Year's War occurs as the fourth intercolonial war between England and France (1756-63). The war progressed as depicted in history.

The relationship strain between England and its 13 American continental colonies (The Thirteen) built up with increased taxation. After the Stamp Act was passed and repealed (1765-66), **calmer heads prevail. The [Declaratory Act of 1766](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaratory_Act) never occurs.** Parliament invited a delegation from each of The Thirteen to work out differences (1766). This extended negotiation (1766-69) blunts Radical demands for independence.

Four pieces of legislation resulted from these negotiations:

* **Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769** or **Rights of Englishmen in America Act of 1769** extended to _continental colonial_ Englishmen (not to Caribbean Colonials)
* **Reform in America Act of 1771** transforms the continental colonies to six provinces: Canada, New England, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Carolina, Georgia. In exchange, each province given limited representation in British Parliament.
* **Rights of Religious Liberty Act of 1772** permits provinces to manage their own religious affairs. In exchange, the American provinces cooperated with levying taxes that paid down British debt.
* **Discovery of Toltec Technology - 30 November 1782.** Ephraim George Biggs, a surveyor, discovered what became known as the Toltec Mound.
