### Space travel

#### Spacecraft

<!-- Do not break the reaction-based system to keep him on the planet. -->

**Design.** Spacecraft are symmetrically built around a frame. Propulsion is reaction-based, so a considerable amount of the ship's total mass is its consumable reaction material. Ships cannot travel in atmosphere as gravity will crush the frame. Travel between planet and orbitals is done through interface vehicles. **Ships are built like office towers** (Pringles cans), with small decks stacked on top of each other, which experience gravity only when the ship is under thrust.

**Travel.** When traveling, ships accelerate to the midpoint of their journey, turn around, and decelerate. No dogfights, no Immelmann or Crazy Ivan maneuvers. Safe travel means accelerating to a midpoint at 1.0-1.5 G, turn around, decelerate at 1.0-1.5 G, over a period of several dys.

**Heat.** Heat is always a problem. An inability to dissipate heat can get one into trouble. Burn your engines too much, or fire too many lasers, and you start to have problems in combat yourself, because of an inability to radiate heat into the darkness of space.

**Payload.** These concerns combine to suggest that a ships payload section is relatively small (10-30% of the shipâ€™s mass), Given the limits on payload, space for crew, weapons, cargo, and extras is limited. Slipdrives are small to allow FTL travel within the design constraints (i.e. we wanted ships both with slipdrives and with guns), and so the limit on FTL travel comes from the point of departure, well above the ecliptic of the system.

#### Inner System

The table below describes the constraints of space travel. Most space ships are fuel constrained based on their acceleration ability, shown by the Duration. Travel between Earth and the Slipsteam is within the limits of those ships. Those with extended durations can travel four times further than regular ships, at the expense of crew comfort. Those ships could safely make it to Uranus and back, but not to the Oort cloud.

* Civilian ships never accelerate at 1G (V-shift 3) beyond a full day.
* Military ships never accelerate at 2G (V-shift 5) beyond a full day.
* Slipknot (5AU) Moon, Mars (1.5AU), Uranus (19AU), Oort (1ly) columns all refer to travel time from Earth to those (average distance) locations.
* To get 1AU, multiply Mars by 0.67 (1G = 3.7dys)

TODO: Confirm whether the numbers are based on full-time or limited acceleration.
