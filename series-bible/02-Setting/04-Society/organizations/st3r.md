### Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research Efforts (ST3R) / Society for Alien Research (SAR)

* 1799 - American archeologists discover Toltec temple inside the Arkansan Toltec Indian Mounds. Within the mounds is a trove of technology and modern-era weaponry, including an advanced, operating computer storing alien technology. The computer and all technology was transported to Philadelphia, which is the center of American social & political life.
* 1800 - The Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research (ST3R) was chartered by King George III to decipher the technology. The war increased the zeal of the research, with the major breakthrough occurring in 1814 discovering that the computer was a patent library exposing centuries of advanced technology.
  * Robert Fulton is ST3R's First Chairman until 1815
  * Simeon North, ST3R 2nd Chairman 1815-1826.
  * Samuel Morse joins in 1810 as apprentice after graduating Yale, ST3R Chairman 1826 after wife's death
  * Henry Blair joined ST3R in 1830
* 1807 - Computer re-energized using what were later identified as solar panels
* 1812 - Language reverse engineered, technology deemed "Alien" instead of "Toltec," though some posit that the Toltecs are descended from Aliens.
* 1814 - ST3R realizes computer stores alien patents
* 1825 - Yale establishes the "Society for Alien Research" (SAR)
* 1826-28 - ST3R moved from Philadelphia to New Haven, Connecticut (Yale)
