### Parliament of British America

The British America Act of 1771 restructured British America (the continent) into six provinces: Canada, New England, Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York), Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia. This led to six Provincial Assemblies.

Each Assembly was bicameral, with the House of Lords appointing the Council of State and province landowners electing members of the Council of Commons. The Crown appoints a Lieutenant Governor as executive to each Province, as well as the Governor of British America. Each provincial government appoints 9 seats to the British Parliament. As a result, the legislature is dominated by local oligarchies. These oligarchs jealously defend their power, thus quieting the American Troubles, and largely followed the Lords' suggestions.
