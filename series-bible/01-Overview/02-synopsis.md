## Synopsis

_**a one-page (4-5 paragraph) summary of the world, major characters and central tension.**_

<!-- Write an overview of the series idea, describing the world or setting it takes place in, the unique conflicts faced, and the dynamics between main characters that fuel the story. This is a great sales tool because you're going to highlight the most interesting facets and themes of the series. You should be able to do this in three paragraphs, but a few pages is ok so long as the writing is "tight" and reads efficiently, moving the story beat by beat. -->

In the 18th century, humanity discovered advanced alien technology in the Toltec Indian mounds. Over the next 150 years, society embraces the technology and develops interstellar travel via the slipstream, all while retaining paranoid nationalism. When they encounter other human settlements on alien worlds, they chose to study them out of concern that "alien" use of slipstream technology puts them at risk.

Albert Strand is a descendent of the original discoverer of the Indian mounds and lives under that shadow. Putting career before family, he lobbied hard to be assigned to the Orbital.
