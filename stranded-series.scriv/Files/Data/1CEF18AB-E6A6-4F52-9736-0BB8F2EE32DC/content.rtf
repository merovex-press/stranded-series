\f1\i\b0\fs22 \cf0 \'93The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite.\'94
\f2\i0 \
While you don\'92t need to know how a gun works to know how to use one, the society as a whole must be able to support the thinkers and builders of such a device for it to see widespread and sustained use. Not so when you have Low Culture High Tech; this is a faction, culture, or race that uses technology far in advance of their scientific and cultural knowledge, often for warfare.\
Usually {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ETGaveUsWifi"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 this group has pirated the technology from someone else}}. It may be {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Lost Technology}} that they have recovered and use, often very sturdy, self-replicating lost tech that only requires raw materials be input, if even that. Or it could be a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Black Box}} tech that none of their existing machines can do without. There may instead be a group of \'93thinkers and builders\'94 who use the primitives as shock troops or even as a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Slave Race}}. It\'92s also possible the tables are turned and the primitives have either taken the builders hostage or killed them all and taken all of their goodies (without bothering {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 with the instruction manual}}). If the original source of the tech is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Shrouded in Myth}}, they may become a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Cargo Cult}}.\
Typically, the primitives will only use a fraction of the technology\'92s potential and not know all of its abilities. At best they will be able to maintain the equipment without knowing how to repair it should a major malfunction happen. It\'92s highly possible that the original creators, or a group with sufficiently advanced science (even just curiosity and a working knowledge of the scientific method), can pull the rug out from under these primitives by either confiscating, hacking, or better using their pirated tech against them.\
It\'92s worth noting that a civilization doesn\'92t have to be at stone age or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Medieval}} levels of technology for this trope to apply. They just have to routinely use tech far in advance of their ability to comprehend. A story set in 21st century Earth could have this trope apply if the planet were given {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Imported Alien Phlebotinum}}. Even space faring peoples can have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Low Culture, High Tech}} if they use stuff they don\'92t understand.\
Lastly, we want to draw attention to the following from the first paragraph \'93far in advance of their scientific and 
\f3\b cultural
\f2\b0  knowledge\'94. It\'92s important to point out that not only are they using things they don\'92t understand technologically, but for which they haven\'92t considered the cultural, social, or ethical ramifications. It\'92s one thing to give a hunter-gatherer society an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBow"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Energy Bow}}, but giving them a cloning device? Their society may crumble from the onset of massive {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Cloning Blues}}, not to mention the ecological disaster of the massive population growth. It\'92s because of this that many aliens (and future humanity) tend to subscribe to an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Alien Non-Interference Clause}} or a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 You Are Not Ready}} attitude.\
