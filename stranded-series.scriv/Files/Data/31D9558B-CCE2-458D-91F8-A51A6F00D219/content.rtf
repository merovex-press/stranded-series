\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\slmult1\sb180\sa180\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs22 \cf0 If being good were as easy as most cartoons make it out to be, everyone would be a saint. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyAesop"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Truth is}}, sometimes Being Good Sucks. Doing the right thing doesn\'92t always {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 feel good}}, is hard to pull off, can be painful, sometimes even harmful, to yourself and others. Being good requires a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Heroic Sacrifice}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 keeping your word}}, and thinking of others before yourself. It means swallowing your {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 pride}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 owning up to}} and apologizing for your mistakes. It means doing the above without expecting a reward (even a spoken {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkNothingOfIt"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 thank you}}), {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepTheReward"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 refusing one if offered}}\'97and most ego-crushing\'97{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 accepting the punishment for being good}}.\
The variations are endless, but below is a condensed catalog:\
\pard\tx0\pardeftab720\li480\fi-480\sl360\slmult1\sb36\sa36\partightenfactor0
\ls1\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	Sacrificing your own happiness: It can be any type of happiness, be it {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 denying romance to protect}} the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Love Interest}}, or where their quest {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 To Be a Master}} is leveraged against a friend\'92s life when the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Friend or Idol Decision}} comes along.\
\'95	Giving up your ambitions: Usually these are selfish or dark ambitions, and denying them 
\f2\i helps
\f1\i0  the character in the long run. When a character wants {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Revenge}} for the murder of a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTarget"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 loved one}} in a world where {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him}}, their giving up murder (though not necessarily forgiving the villain) will cost them dearly but ultimately be the right thing. However, this can extend to less dark goals, when {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Ambition Is Evil}}. If the story deems the character\'92s dream as \'93selfish\'94 or bad, they have no choice but to give up.\
\'95	Good behaviour. Obvious as it is, being good requires 
\f2\i acting
\f1\i0  good. This means sharing, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 forgiving others}}, not killing people and generally acting contrary to one\'92s impulses to be a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Jerkass}} to those disliked. No matter how much they may wish or be tempted to do otherwise.\
\'95	Humility and honesty. Honesty is a big source of Suck when being good. It means that any wrong doing on your part (or your friends\'92) must be revealed. Worse, it means denying {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Protagonist-Centered Morality}} and obeying the law. The character may find that to do what is right means going against stupid laws, becoming a wanted man, separated from loved ones, with their \'93reputation\'94 ruined.\
\'95	Doing the right thing {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 doesn\'92t always mean it\'92s the nice thing.}} Often in dilemmas where the character has to choose to either {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeLawfulOrGood"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 uphold a moral standard or being kind to others}}. Whether it\'92s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelToBeKind"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 doing nasty deeds to save someone\'92s life}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 telling an uncomfortable truth}}, or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleTouchVsFirmHand"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 guiding someone harshly in order for them to learn}}, the character will have to go against their kind nature and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 do what they have to do}} for the sake of doing what\'92s right. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasTooHardOnHim"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The character will not enjoy this at all}}. This may cause other characters to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 hate and resent the hero for making tough decisions that he is morally obligated to do.}}\
\'95	{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Redemption}}: A character realizing that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Being Evil Sucks}} will turn to the side of good, only to find out that it comes at a price since {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsAffliction"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Redemption Equals Affliction}}. This means the character has to put aside their ego and acknowledge that they are in the wrong, accept their karmic punishment, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 work hard to regain the trust and respect from others}}, even if people {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButRejected"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 aren\'92t willing to forgive}} or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenButNotForgotten"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 at least forget}} what they\'92ve done.\
\'95	Giving up on a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Love Interest}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 so that they can be truly happy with someone else}}, or somewhere else, or doing something else. You may end up with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 someone else}}\'85or you may end up a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Celibate Hero}} or dead.\
\'95	Giving up some comfort because someone else has a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterNeedThanMine"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Greater Need Than Mine}}.\
\'95	Saving people, even if they don\'92t deserve it. Whether the person in need of saving is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 The Bully}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Alpha Bitch}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 a group of characters who hate and mistreat the hero}}, or even {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 the villain}}, the hero must suck it up and lend a hand to his enemies and rivals, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefuseToRescueTheDisliked"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 refusing to save them and let them suffer their fate}} is a huge no no. It doesn\'92t matter if they {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 continue to show him zero respect after being saved}}, the hero must keep on saving them whether they like it or not.\
\'95	Achieving a goal by doing things the honorable way. By honorable, we mean that the character must understand that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsEasy"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Evil Is Easy}}, and he must work at the crack of dawn, avoid taking shortcuts, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 avoid the temptation of doing things that would jeopardize their morals as well as the people around them}}, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 declining any offer of success given to them all in the name of hard work.}}\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\slmult1\sb180\sa180\partightenfactor0
\cf0 At times, it can lock characters into {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Status Quo Is God}}, where success requires an evil action, making winning and staying good impossible.\
On the other side of the fence, this crops up when {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Evil Feels Good}}. Often applies to a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Heel\'96Face Turn}} character, or a hero who laments that they have to save somebody they hate from a burning building, or they don\'92t get to kill their most hated enemy, because that\'92s the \'93heroic\'94 decision.\
In a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Crapsack World}}, this trope applies to a great degree but being 
\f2\i anything
\f1\i0  in such a world generally sucks.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\slmult1\sb180\sa180\partightenfactor0
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeTropes"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Contrast}} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Being Evil Sucks}}. Also, see {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Downer Ending}}, or, if you\'92re lucky, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Earn Your Happy Ending}}. Compare {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 No Good Deed Goes Unpunished}}, where the good action (rather than the process of being good) is what gets the characters in trouble. May result in someone expressing {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheHero"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Sympathy for the Hero}}. Contrast {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Karma Houdini Warranty}}, where trying to turn over a new leaf can bring down heaven\'92s wrath. This is one way people become an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Iron Woobie}} or a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Knight In Sour Armor}}, depending on whether the suffering is taken with quiet dignity or grumpy complaining. This belief is the original mentality of a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralPragmatist"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Moral Pragmatist}} before a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Heel\'96Face Turn}} or someone tries to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Cut Lex Luthor a Check}}, but they may wind up here again if they\'92re proven right.\
There are many instances in real life in which being \'91good\'92 doesn\'92t suck that much. Scientifically, deeds perceived as good - whether or not they are good - entail social recognition and approval, and bad deeds entail reprisal. Most villains or villainous groups might also view their actions as \'91good\'92 in some sense, however, and therefore it might be unclear that this counts as \'91good\'92 in the same sense as a story with an author-determined moral compass. Justice is one of the fundamental evolutionary imperatives that allows human society to function coherently; we may not all be saints, but we\'92re not all lawless murderers. Unless you\'92re a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Villain with Good Publicity}} It\'92s usually more profitable to abide by society\'92s rules, and even in that case you could be best off being {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Affably Evil}}. However, the more you could influence perception in such a context, the less it would matter here whether or not you were evil. Of course, multiple societies might have different and often conflicting moral codes, even within their own confines; further, if people like Karl Marx (himself a \'91villain\'92 to some, but not all) are to be believed, the conflict within societies can sometimes be such as to give rise to fundamentally opposed forces and force recourse to struggle. Further, moral codes change over time, and this occasionally leads to conflicts between earlier morality and new trends. As a result, a simplistic application of the story-telling categories of \'91villains\'92 and \'91heroes\'92 from fiction to real life might be worth avoiding, when it comes to this trope.}
