            <Title>Mortimer Seeks Ephraim in Shippensburg</Title>
            <Synopsis>Meanwhile, Reece shows up at Jeff's house on the trail, but Jeff avoids giving up his brother; but Reece learned that Ephraim was trained as a smith. He has his men comb the countryside looking for towns with new smiths.</Synopsis>
            <Text>**November 10, N.S. 1762** Even with the leaves falling off the trees, Mortimer Bethlehem thought America was beautiful. At least the middle colonies part of America. New England had its beauties, more in the inhabitants than the scenery. The Carolinas were too hot and sandy. The Quakers managed to pick the best part of America. The further away from Philadelphia they rode, the more he enjoyed the scenery.

The road widened as they entered the town. The afternoon sun just started to dip below the tops of the trees. Sharpsburg, he thought they named it. As they rode through, it looked quaint enough. Grey stone buildings in the Georgian style. They were not going anywhere. He chuckled when he saw the wooden fort. He pointed it out to Dorian Mabbott. "Sharpsburg has permanent buildings but temporary fortifications. They should be glad hostilities are at an end."

"Shippensburg, sir."

"What?"

"We are in Shippensburg, sir. Named for Chief Justice Shippen." Dorian's tone was respectful.

"Quite right. Shippens-burg." He muttered its name a few times under his breath. "Still, he does have a beautiful wife."

"Who, sir?"

"His Honorable Judge Shippen."

"Yes, sir."

"Do you see the church?"

"Not yet, sir. I doubt he's in one. They're Presbyterians out in the country. He was trained in the Puritan tradition."

Mortimer chuckled at that. _Puritans are a tradition? Hardly._ "Damned separatists. The Church of England is the only civil church. God save the King."

His men repeated in unison, "God save the king."

"Still, I'll buy you a pint if he's not found in a church."

They rode until they came to the tavern. "Widow Piper's Tavern. Handsome structure, that. Such clean lines. I wonder who built it?" He shifted in his saddle. It had been a long ride. "Come on, let's give it some business."

He and his men dismounted and tied their horses. Mortimer paused a few more minutes to study the shape of the building. For an American tavern, it was not terribly large. Its size was more like the alehouses in London.

The ten of them entered the tavern. Describe interior.

- [ ]: TODO: Visit the Widow Piper's Inn

The common area was just large enough for his entourage. A woman, probably Widow Piper, worked the fire by the hearth.

"Good evening, madam."

She looked up. "How can I be of service?" The Scottish burr was distinct, unsoftened by her time in America.

"If you have lodging," pointing his hat at his men, "we will be staying the night."

She smiled. "Aye. No boarders today."

"Splendid. We've just arrived from." He paused an turned to Dorian.

"Harrisburg, sir."

"Yes. Quite. Harrisburg. Hard journey. We are famished."

"Well, you're in luck. We have a meat pie, hasty pudding with bacon, oatmeal porridge, a dish of eggs and beer. Should be ready in an hour."

"No ale, perhaps?" Mortimer said.

"Aye, ale beer."

After a pint, Mortimer's men took the horses to the nearby stable while Moritmer and Dorian remained. They were on their second pint. The prices were lower than Mortimer would have expected. It was a decent ale, even if too malty for his palette.

"Mrs. Piper. Have you recently had a visitor?"

"This is a tavern, sir. With all the travel between Philadelphia and the wilderness, we usually have several visitors. Usually redcoats or trappers. It starts to slow down about this season."

"Anyone by the name of Ephraim Biggs?" Dorian jumped in.

Mortimer felt a little exasperated. Dorian was younger, always in haste.

"No Ephraim Biggs. There is a Jeffry Biggs here in town."

Mortimer sat up a little. "Oh?"

"Aye. He lives just on the other side of the fort."

Dorian continued, "has he been here long?"

"He brought his family here a couple years ago. Once the indian troubles started to quiet down a bit."

"Pastor?"

"Oh, no. Worse. He's a lawyer."

"There does not seem to be much calling for the law out here." Mortimer injected.

"You'd be surprised. He works for Judge Shippen, who owns all the land around us. Once the war is over, they'll be selling plots of land. Mr. Biggs will be handling the surveys and sales. He usually comes in every morning for a beer and Indian pudding with the missus being with child."

* * *

The next morning, Mortimer and Dorian sat over breakfast and waited. Mrs. Piper described Jeffry to them, so they were prepared. They did not wait long. A somewhat tall man with reddish-brown hair came into the tavern.

"Jeffry!"

The man reflexively looked their way.

"Join us."

"I'm sorry. Who are you?"

"I'm Captain Bethlehem, and this is Ensign Mabbott. You are Jeffry Biggs, land broker?"

That seemed to put Jeffry at ease. He hesitated for a moment before joining them at the table. Mortimer observed his mannerisms as an odd mix of gentleman and commoner. Jeffry was pretending at being one, probably a gentleman.

There was serving bowl of Indian pudding. Mortimer pushed it toward Jeffry. He offered a spare bowl and wooden spoon to Jeffry, who took it from him. Jeffry filled his bowl. Dorian set a mug of ale at Jeffry's place. The three ate together, trading small talk for most of the meal.

"Thank you, gentlemen, for that wonderful breakfast. Piper has excellent pudding. I am afraid we are not offering plots for sale quite yet. Once a peace treaty is signed, perhaps."

"I imaging in time Shippensburg will be a thriving city. Handsome countryside. We are not here for that. Have you heard from your brother Ephraim?"

Jeffry paused for a moment. His facial expression changed almost imperceptibly. It was enough for Mortimer to judge that Ephraim was here recently. "No, I haven't. He should be in New Haven." Mortimer thought Jeffry did not sound like he expected Ephraim to actually be in New Haven.

"Should be, but he is not. He left New Haven some months ago, and I'm tasked with finding him."

"Is he in some sort of trouble?"

Mortimer paused. As a younger brother, he would want nothing better but for his older brother to disappear. Then he would have title and would not be traipsing over the back side of America, to Mortimer's brother's delight. Would Jeffry protect his brother or not? Mortimer decided confronting him with a hard statement would yield a worthwhile reaction. "I'm afraid he is. Ephraim Biggs murdered an English officer last June in New Haven. I've been dispatched to find him for execution."

Dorian started to react when Mortimer cut him off with a glare. It denied him the chance to see Jeffry's reaction.

"But...No. I don't believe it. Jeffy isn't the murderous sort."

Mortimer let a silent pause work for him. Colonial Colonel Whiting hated playing All Fours against Mortimer because of his ability to read the other players. He tried those tactics here. When Jeffry looked down, he gave a glance and wink to Dorian. "Tried and convicted, I'm afraid. He managed to escape the jail soon after. Ensign Mabbott and I have been in pursuit ever since. He gave us a slip in Philadelphia, but we hear rumor that he headed this way. Pray, when did you last see your brother?"

"Not since he went to Yale."

It was a lie that Mortimer read easily. He opted to change tact. "Well, he must not have come this way, then. We were convinced he would seek refuge with family. Ensign, you may have been right. He went to Baltimore." He noticed Jeffry relax his shoulders, though the look of shock on his face remained. "What amazed me that a Puritan ministerial student would be capable of murder with his bare hands. How is it that you became an attorney and he went a different path?"

"We weren't born into wealth, if that's what you mean. Our forefathers were smiths. Our grandfather came over after Queen Anne's War. Our father did well enough to send us to college so we could advance the family's position."

"So you worked in the smithy as lads? That would explain Ephraim's ability to crush a man's throat." Mentally, Mortimer moved the Biggs down several social pegs. Commoners pretending to be elitists. That was the mode in America, with men thinking they can climb some social ladder and forget their places. It was different for aristocrats. They already had their place. All that remained was jockeying for position.

The meal ended abruptly there. The interrogation stole whatever appetite Jeffry still had. He thanked them and left.

"What was that about?" Dorian said.

"About the conviction? I had to know whether Jeffry knew about the murder. I dressed it up a bit." He set back in his chair. He steepled his hands together, and tapped his upper lip. "His brother went through here, but failed to tell his brother why. I doubt they are very close. Jeffry is quite a few years older. Did you notice anything else?"

"They are smiths."

"Quite. Ephraim will not conceal himself as a pastor. Too obvious, and not as much call for that out here. Scottish Presbyterians and Purtain Separatists."

"You suppose he reverted to smithing?"

"It makes sense. Either that or he's fled the country and gone south." Ensign Mabbott had not been in America for long. Mortimer decided to size him up a bit. "What course of action do you propose?"

"Well, we are close to Indian country. There are not too many places that could take a smith. He could have fled south, but his resources would only take him too far. I'll wager a pint that he is in a nearby town working as a smith."

"How do you propose we find out?"

"Divide our forces. Winter is fast approaching. But, if we send the men out a few days in any direction, we should figure out if he is in the area or has passed through."

_My thoughts exactly._ "Sobeit. Split the team and send them out. Have them all report back in a fortnight." Widow Piper's is a fine place for us to headquarter until they return. See to it."

* * *

The next morning, Dorian assembled his men and instructed them to visit the next two towns down each road, then report back. That would fit within Bethlehem's orders and give some indication which way Ephraim went. He told them to ask for a preacher or smith, working on the theory Ephraim was using his trade. They broke up and headed to the stable to ride on.

A few minutes later, Sergeant Tailor returned with a sheepish look on his face. "Sir, Doris has a limp."

"Sergeant, I don't know what you do with your mounts. They always come up limp."

"I dunno, sir. It's not like I had them growing up." Sergeant Tailor's accent came from the worst parts of London.

Ensign Mabbott knew where they found him, a jail not much farther from there. "Fine. Take myBlack Betty. She's rock steady. But go easy on her. She's still a bit wild."</Text>

            <Text>Faster-than-light travel is possible via wormholes, known as Slipstreams. IRL, wormholes are a scientific conjecture, derived from the same equations that describe black holes. We cannot conceive of how to get to or use a wormhole. In Strand, however, wormholes are a convenient means of travel from one place to another. People traverse wormholes using a Jump drive, with each wormhole connecting between only two locations. Travel time is near instantaneous for the jumping ship and its occupants.

A Slipknot is the term used by Toltecs and adopted by English (Laufknoten in German, Trou de Biche (tru-de-beesh) in French, Hueco in Spanish, Orifício in Portuguese).

            <Synopsis>He explores the temple, finding the lantern, then weapons, then massive trove.

He finds a way out of the Temple, but the pursuit resumes when he gives away his position.

He shoots the hunting party killing the five of them in rapid succession. Rather than run, he loots the bodies for shoes and uses their arrows to conceal the wounds.

With a makeshift sled, he pulls out his samples and heads to Philadelphia, but he stops by his place in Smithytown, which alerts Mortimer that he is not dead.

Meanwhile, Kariwase discovers the slain warrior party and discovers the ruse, bewildered he tracks Mortimer's sled until he realizes it is leaving their territory.

Mortimer, alerted to Ephraim's return confronts the Smithy, but is thwarted somehow, and has his men resume searching neighboring towns while he goes back to Jeffry.</Synopsis>

            <Title>Neutrino Energy</Title>
            <Text>Neutrino energy is a theoretical way of converting the kinetic energy of cosmic into into direct current (DC) electricity.
The energy is converted by layers a conductive film, silicone film and graphene film. The conductive film comprises silver, gold, copper, gallium or aluminum or one of their alloys, in particular of a silver or gold alloy or an aluminum-gallium alloy. Each film layer is very fine, measured in 100s of nanometers. See Neutrino Power Cube[sec:neutrino-power-cube] for the scientific application.

IRL Research:

* The neutrino is the source of abundant, clean, renewable energy.[^nutrino-energy]
* Neutrinovoltaic - a low voltage system of 12/24/48V DC
* Neutrino Film is "a film made of metal or a metal alloy, in particular a film made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a so-called neutrino or ntrino film (registered trademarks), to a method of production and to a use of a film made of metal or a metal alloy." [^WO2016142056A1]
* Neutrino Power Cubes are highly sophisticated power cells that have the advantage of being able to supply energy in complete darkness. They do this by harnessing the kinetic energy created by invisible waves of cosmic radiation, transforming it into micro-vibrations in a complex resonation process facilitated by super-symmetrical coatings on a stable substrate. And because these power cells can be stacked on top of one another, they are more compact and efficient than today’s solar cells and far less easily damaged.[^Neutrino-energy]
* Neutrino Energy Harvesting is when energy can be derived from many different sources such as radio waves, vibrations, heat, or light, and these sources can be either natural or artificial. Solar cells convert light; thermoelectric generators convert heat flux (temperature differences); and Neutrino Power Cubes convert vibrations caused by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos into electricity.[^Neutrino-Wiki]

            <Text>##### Society for Alien/American/Advanced Research (SAR)

**Overview.** Originally called the Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research Efforts (ST3R), the Society for Alien Research (SAR) is a limited crown company charged with deciphering Toltec technology into viable capabilities that keeps Britain globally dominant.

**Naming Confusion.** The original name owes to a misunderstanding of archeology, which was subsequently renamed in various times as either the Society for Alien (or) American (or) Advanced Research.

**The Babylonian Captivity.** ST3R operated on the grounds of Franklin's Public Academy of Philadelphia. Its move from Philadelphia to Yale under Kneass' directorship, a period known as the Babylonian Captivity by College of Philadelphia members. It returned to Philadelphia after Kneass' death in 1840 and remained since.

#### Timeline

&lt;!-- * 1782 November 30 - American surveyor Ephraim George Biggs discovered Toltec temple under the Arkansan Toltec Mounds. Within the mounds is a trove of technology and modern-era weaponry, including an advanced, operating computer storing alien technology. The computer and all technology was transported to Philadelphia, which is the center of American social &amp; political life.
* 1784 April 9 - The Society for Toltec Technology Trove Research (ST3R) was chartered by King George III to decipher the technology. The Fifth French War increased the zeal of the research, with the major breakthrough occurring in 1814 discovering that the computer was a patent library exposing centuries of advanced technology.
* 1807 - Computer re-energized using what were later identified as solar panels
* 1812 - Language reverse engineered, technology deemed "Alien" instead of "Toltec," though some posit that the Toltecs are descended from Aliens.
* 1814 - ST3R realizes computer stores alien patents
* 1825 - Yale establishes the "Society for Alien Research" (SAR)
* 1826-40 - ST3R moved from Philadelphia, New Haven, Connecticut (Yale)
* 1840 - SAR returned to Salomon’s House, Philadelphia --&gt;

### Low Culture, High Tech

*"The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite."*

While you don't need to know how a gun works to know how to use one, the society as a whole must be able to support the thinkers and builders of such a device for it to see widespread and sustained use. Not so when you have Low Culture High Tech; this is a faction, culture, or race that uses technology far in advance of their scientific and cultural knowledge, often for warfare.

Usually [this group has pirated the technology from someone else](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ETGaveUsWifi). It may be [Lost Technology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology) that they have recovered and use, often very sturdy, self-replicating lost tech that only requires raw materials be input, if even that. Or it could be a [Black Box](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox) tech that none of their existing machines can do without. There may instead be a group of "thinkers and builders" who use the primitives as shock troops or even as a [Slave Race](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace). It's also possible the tables are turned and the primitives have either taken the builders hostage or killed them all and taken all of their goodies (without bothering [with the instruction manual](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup)). If the original source of the tech is [Shrouded in Myth](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth), they may become a [Cargo Cult](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult).

Typically, the primitives will only use a fraction of the technology's potential and not know all of its abilities. At best they will be able to maintain the equipment without knowing how to repair it should a major malfunction happen. It's highly possible that the original creators, or a group with sufficiently advanced science (even just curiosity and a working knowledge of the scientific method), can pull the rug out from under these primitives by either confiscating, hacking, or better using their pirated tech against them.

It's worth noting that a civilization doesn't have to be at stone age or [Medieval](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture) levels of technology for this trope to apply. They just have to routinely use tech far in advance of their ability to comprehend. A story set in 21st century Earth could have this trope apply if the planet were given [Imported Alien Phlebotinum](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum). Even space faring peoples can have [Low Culture, High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech) if they use stuff they don't understand.

Lastly, we want to draw attention to the following from the first paragraph "far in advance of their scientific and **cultural** knowledge". It's important to point out that not only are they using things they don't understand technologically, but for which they haven't considered the cultural, social, or ethical ramifications. It's one thing to give a hunter-gatherer society an [Energy Bow](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBow), but giving them a cloning device? Their society may crumble from the onset of massive [Cloning Blues](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues), not to mention the ecological disaster of the massive population growth. It's because of this that many aliens (and future humanity) tend to subscribe to an [Alien Non-Interference Clause](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause) or a [You Are Not Ready](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady) attitude.

Related to [Insufficiently Advanced Alien](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufficientlyAdvancedAlien), which is about a race that's interstellar, but every other tech they have sucks comparatively, *and* they probably don't understand it. Compare [Crystal Spires and Togas](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas). Contrast [Rock Beats Laser](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser). The [Noble Savage](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage) inverts this trope, being essentially High Culture, Low Tech. See also [Bamboo Technology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology), [Aliens Never Invented the Wheel](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel), [Scavenger World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld), [Giving Radio to the Romans](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingRadioToTheRomans), [Technology Uplift](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyUplift) and [Cargo Cult](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CargoCult). Not to be confused with "[High Tech and Low Life.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk)" Compare [Klingon Scientists Get No Respect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect), when a society undervalues the profession that make its desired lifestyle possible. Not to be confused with [No Tech but High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTechButHighTech).

            <Title>1764-1840: The Indian Problem</Title>
            <Text>At the end of the Seven Year's War, an estimated 4.5 million Indians lived in North America.[@calloway2007scratch] Britain was sensitive to protect its new territorial gains by not antagonizing them. In Summer 1763, Parliament debated constraining its settlers on the Atlantic side of the Appalachian continental divide as a suite of measures to establish greater control over the colonies and improve Indian relations. Discovery of advanced weaponry and their role in thwarting Pontiac's Rebellion tabled the Proclamation of 1763.

The home rule negotiation led to establishing new colonies in Indian territory. Those colonies were expected to become provinces when full British sovereignty was exerted and Englishmen were comfortable "in their hearths and homes." Americans agreed to fund British Army operations to secure settlers in those areas and accelerate this effort. They also formed local militia that operated under Army authority. Mississippi colony welcomed a higher number of British military veterans, leading to a strong military tradition in that region.

This is too American. The British would have handled it like they did India. See [@keay1995honourable]

This agreement did not sit well with the Indians, who continued to harass settlers. The 1768 Stanwix and Hard Labour treaties ceded control from some indians, but not all. War flared up in 1774 and continued through 1782.[^indian-war-1770s] The role of the French led to renewed hostilities between France and England before France was ready. This led to a hot war between the two sides from 1778 to 1783.

[^indian-war-1770s]: OTL: This is consistent with history apart from the impact on the American Revolution. British supported the indians until news in 1782 of the peace treaty. [@WesternTheaterAmerican2020]

The Ohio War of the 1780s flared up over increased white settlement, aided by French agents and a splinter group from the Sons of Liberty who thought that Ohio should become an independent nation. The Battle of Fallen Timbers of 1784 broke the back of Indian resistance. This paved the way for English settlement of southern and western Ohio.

            <Text>#### British North America

Prior to about 1760, north of Spanish Florida, the Appalachian Divide represented the boundary between British and French colonial possessions in North America. After the French &amp; Indian War, England sought to clarify the boundaries. Under the _British North America Act of 1771_, the Original Thirteen colonies were re-organized into six provinces. Each of the sections below discusses each province in a bit more detail.

When debating whether to let the colonies have representation, many feared that Americans would eventually outnumber the home country. The solution hit upon manipulated the colonial borders in an effort to create division within each colony. This is the similar solution employed IRL.

We group the historic Thirteen Colonies before introducing new territories carved out of the lands acquired from the French.

            <Text>### Overview

&lt;!-- format-overview --&gt;
**Strand** is a novella series broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 8--10 novellas as "chapters." This follows the [UK drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) or [Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) series season length. (See [research](research/season-episode.md))

**Pattern.** Seasons follow three intertwined storylines: combat, espionage/technology and diplomacy.

* Combat - this storyline deals with the use of force.
* Espionage - this storyline deals with exploration and theft of the ancient technology by various factions.
* Diplomacy - this storyline addresses changes in sectarian and international politics.

**Reading Length.** A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel. (See Audience) Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but the storylines will either be incomplete or hinting at the future.
&lt;!-- /format-overview --&gt;

### Reading Analysis

* Season
  - Each season comprises 10 novella-length episodes with a target episode length is 30,000±2,500 words, which is 90±7 pages.
  - Each season is 300,000±25,000 words, or about three 100,000 word novels; trilogy length.
  - Box sets comprise five books where each book is two episodes.
* Episode
  - Each novella episode comprises 8 three-scene segments; 24 sections  (~1250 words per section).
  - Each scene services a different storyline, with three storylines per episode.
  - Thus, each storyline comprises eight segments, which while integrated are otherwise standalone.
* Reading Length
  - Reading pace: Average adult reading time is 220 wpm.[^reading]
  - Therefore, each novella should take about 2 1/2 hours to read ± 10%
* Listening Length
  - Listening pace: Audible standard voice pace is 150 wpm.[^listening]
  - A novella should complete in about 3 1/2 hours, which should be long enough to support one-leg if a flight.
  - A season should complete in about 33 hours, which should be enough to entertain a trucker for a week.

### Season Pattern

The following is the season pattern, as well as the per-episode structure.

1. **Stasis** - Everyday life, ends with inciting incident
2. **Trigger** - Beyond control triggers the story
3. **Quest Fail 1-3**
4. **Quest Fail 2**
5. **Quest Fail 3**
6. **Surprise** - Something unexpected to reader and character ruins the quest.
7. **Critical Choice** - Character makes a decision that reveals the character's true nature
8. **Defeat / Climax** - Critical choice leads to the darkest moment.
9. **Reversal** - Character reverses behavior as a result
10. **Resolution** - New stasis.

We plot the episodes in order: 10, 1, 6, 2-5, 9, 7, 8.

### Episode Pattern

* **Trio Pattern.** Each episode comprises three storylines where each storyline comprises eight segments.
  - Combat covers the tactical, human conflict (with blood as necessary).
  - Diplomacy engages the world changing political, social aspects of the divergence.
  - Stealth brings in the back-stabbing, conniving element, which is tied to either Combat or Diplomacy.

            <Text>#### Mississippi

Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Mississippi was established as a Crown colony encompassing the unsettled region south of the Ohio river down to the Gulf of Mexico, West of the Mississippi and East of the Continental Divide. Essentially, this is the south-of-Ohio Mississippi watershed.

Mississippi will later include the modern-day cities of (TN) Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Clarksville, Murfreesboro, (MS) Jackson, (AL) Huntsville, (KY) Louisville, and Lexington.
Atlanta &amp; Tallahassee are on the Georgia side of the Mississippi-Georgia border.

Mississippi developed slower than Charlotina due to a less benign climate and native population, until similar temples were discovered in its hinterlands. 
A strong military tradition started in Mississippi after the British government gave land grants to officer and enlisted veterans of the Seven Year's War. Similar grants were given in subsequent wars.

**Boundaries.**
The Mississippi-Pennsylvania border follows the Monongahela River from Pittsburgh until it hits the Pennsylvania-Virginia border line (West Virginia, IRL) just south of Point Marion.
The Mississippi-Virginia border follows the Mason-Dixon line East from where the Mississippi-Pennsylvania line intersect it until it intersects the Northern Branch Potomac River, north of Cumberland, VA. From there it follows the IRL boundary between Maryland and Virginia until reaches the Potomac head waters at 39°14′15″N 79°29′8″W.
The Mississippi-Carolina border...
The boundary with Georgia &amp; Carolina is separated by the Chattahoochee River with Mississippi encompassing all land West until the Chattahoochee head water, then the shortest-route to Carolina.[^OTL-Mississippi-boundaries]

Story: Ephraim killed a British officer and was found guilty, only to escape and flee to the edge of society seeking refuge with his brother. Jeffry refuses, but also gives him lead time to flee into the wilderness, where Ephraim is pursued by Indians and falls into the Temple. With advanced weapons in hand, he tries to get them to Sons of Liberty, only to be captured by Mortimer. When Pontiac's Rebellion is known, he relents to his brother's pressure to surrender the location of the temple (and take Mortimer &amp; militia there) to get more weapons to lift the seige of Ft. Pitt. In compensation, Mortimer lets Ephraim free by agreeing to say he was killed in the fighting. Ephraim decides to go to South Carolina under an assumed name, but murders &amp; robs Solomon Sharpe first.</Text>

            <Text>##### Sons of Liberty

&gt; The Sons of Liberty was a secret organization that was created in the Thirteen American Colonies to advance the rights of the European colonists and to fight taxation by the British government. It played a major role in most colonies in battling the Stamp Act in 1765.

During the Point of Divergence, calmer heads prevailed, leading to successful redress of the Sons of Liberty grievances. A splinter group remained, led by Sam Adams &amp; John Brown. As part of the settlement, the violent Sons were identified by the Sons' leadership.

During the Discovery season, the Sons are actively hunted by a British organization led by Ephraim Lapham and John Tremain.

Those rebels who were arrested were put on trial, and most were found guilty of insurrection against the Crown---100 in total were convicted. They were punished either by death (if a leader) or transportation to Australia, which had replaced British America as a penal colony after the Reform in America Act of 1771. Public hanging took place in the Parliament House Square (seat of Parliament of North America, formerly the Pennsylvania State House, Independence Hall IRL).

            <Text>##### Mississippi Land Company

The Mississippi Land Company formed in 1763 following the British victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763) in North America. The company sought to acquire land grants in the vast former New France region between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River ceded by France to Britain after the war.

The Mississippi Land Company was formed by colonial Virginians including George Washington, John Augustine Washington, Richard Henry Lee, Arthur Lee, and William Fitzhugh. The company hoped to establish a new colony in the Mississippi Valley by petitioning the Crown for 2.5 million acres (10,000 km²) in what became Charlotina and parts of northern Mississippi.[^MississippiLandCompany]

[^MississippiLandCompany]: OTL: Their timing was poor, because the British government soon issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which put a temporary halt to the western expansion of the British colonies. Although the boundary line established by the proclamation was extended westward in the following years, the Mississippi Company was never granted lands, and ceased to operate by about 1770.

### Absent Aliens

*"I remember telling my college professor I wanted to study Xenoarcheology. He laughed right in my face. 'There’s nothing to study,' he said. 'It’s all dead space. No alien life exists out in the universe.' In a way, I guess he was right..."*

Humanity has [explored the galaxy, and in some stories the universe][FsNUD7SB], and it turns out the truth *isn't* out there. There are no aliens, or at least, no intelligent ones.

**Done for a variety of reasons:**

- Not every sci-fi plot requires aliens.
- Avoids [Rubber-Forehead Aliens][GqX8Vioh], and saves having to think up decent [Starfish Aliens][xlF6LiU0].
- Isolates humanity in the depressing void of space.
- Saves on the effects budget.
- Makes it easier to make characters [relatable and believable][EG3VzInS].
- Is consistent with the fact that no aliens have yet been found. (See [Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness][2sEX3v1f].)
- Even if aliens did theoretically exist, in settings where the population is confined to a single star system and there is no FTL, neither humanity nor the aliens would be in any position to encounter the other.
- Theoretically, intelligence could be a rare evolutionary fluke, rare at least elsewhere in the Milky Way. Even if intelligence evolves on other planets, it may be extinct by the time humans leave the Solar System, or alternatively, humanity could be extinct by the time aliens leave *their* home system. Thus, even interstellar civilizations may be separated by immense distances or timescales, and unlikely to interact.
- The focus of the Sci-Fi in question is a political struggle between human populations, and aliens could either help them resolve their differences or serve as a threat encouraging them to do so themselves.
- Is free of the [Unfortunate Implications][r8KSGfxj] that cultures that spent time building monuments and functioning societies [lacked the intelligence to do things like that on their own][7tzNe2qF], or that "low-tech" is synonymous with "backwards".
- Raises the [Driving Question][zERAZ2L5] of what happened to the aliens, and whether humanity could be next.

There may be a few cursory alien plants and rodents or perhaps a [Monster of the Week][rX7Nq7OF], which is generally filled by humans, genetically engineered monsters, and robots. An ongoing work does not have to stay this way; it can provide a [Game Changer][LjioIOaM] with [First Contact][KCTXBOEj] when the writers need to shake things up.

One of two standard solutions to the [Fermi Paradox][Wuwb29XT]; the other is [Invisible Aliens][ssGcqtp7], in which aliens exist but are being hidden or removed by [Applied Phlebotinum][UIWzLzRL].

            <Synopsis>Kariwase and his band stalk up on trappers sleeping, and capture them. Bewildered, the lead trapper speaks in French, until Kariwase points out the English accent. Kariwase observes how the French &amp; Indian war started, then does the same to the trapper to the excitement of his men.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Prolog

Sunday May 1, N.S. 1763. Rays from the pre-dawn sun filtered through the upper branches. Kariwase scanned the perimeter of the clearing. He and his fellow Shawnee smelled the smoke a few miles downwind. Over the past hour, they quietly positioned themselves around the campsite. The white trappers chose a site flanked on three sides by hills and on a fourth by the river. Kariwase thanked the Great Spirit they chose poorly.

Satisfied his warriors were in place, he stood. He walked down the incline and into the camp. The six trappers were asleep about their now extinguished camp fire. Their haul sat in a two piles: pelts in one, carcasses in another. Flies had already started the process of returning the beavers to nature. Kariwase took no notice of this, it was little different in their camps. Over the smell of rotting meat, he knew could smell the stench of the English.

He kicked one in the head, hard enough to wake him. The stomach would have been softer, but not as rewarding. He held his war mace behind his arm, hiding it from the trappers.

"Ow! Amos---" The trapper's voice trailed off when he looked at who kicked him. The trapper looked about, not seeing the other indians.

"What are you doing here?" Kariwase said.

"I don't understand." The trapper responded in French, far louder than necessary.

Kariwase switched to French. "What are you doing here? Do you understand that?"

"Yes." Again, louder than necessary. One of the nearby trappers stirred, slowly at first, then suddenly when he realized what was going on.

"So answer me."

"What does it look like? We are Quebecois trapping beaver."

Kariwase tutted. "I know the Quebecois trappers in this area."

The trapper interrupted "We're new."

"And I know the accent. French is not your mother tongue. You are English."

The other trapper kicked the legs of the man next to him. His stare at Kariwase failed to mask its hostility.

"Hey!" yelped the other. The other trappers all began to rouse.

"We are not English," the first trapper said.

"You certainly are not French, or Quebecois. Based on your accent, I would say Virginians." Using his left hand, Kariwase pointed toward a few of his warriors on the opposing rise. The warriors, in turn, raised and lowered their flintlocks. "We killed many Virginians."

The trapper switched to English. "Bloody fine. Then you will know you are on English, and therefore Virginian soil."

Kariwase let that statement feed his anger. He chose instead to play with his victims. "This was my land long before it was yours."

The trapper stood and spat. "Good luck keeping it."

Without signaling his move, he swung the concealed war mace. He drove with his hips, putting all the power he could into the swing. The mace head connected with a satisfying thud. The trapper toppled, falling in the direction of the swing and toward the extinguished camp fire. The skull revealed the divot from the impact.

The other awake trappers recoiled in shock.

Other warriors whooped and joined in the fray. They used the butts of their flintlocks to bash the skulls of the other trappers, not discriminating whether the trappers were awake, semi-awake or asleep.

Kariwase looked on approvingly. Two of the warriors had just come of age. He thought spilling English blood was a good initiation. Rather than motion them to stop, he let them expend their energy on the corpses. It was over in a few minutes.

The carnage over, he smiled. He remembered the story of how the last war started. Tanacharison washed his hands with a Frenchman's brains. Kariwase dropped his mace and drew his tomahawk. He hacked the Englishman's skull open, and repeated the ritual. His fellow warriors smiled approvingly.

They know the story. Good. Soon, we will start a new war that will drive the English out of our homeland.

Kariwase and his band looted the corpses for anything useful. He distributed the beaver pelts to those who participated in the ambush. The two who held back went empty handed. They would not hold back again.

            <Title>Ephraim seeks refuge with stranger, but with suspicion</Title>
            <Synopsis>Ephriam goes to another town and gets hired as a smith who comments on his breeding, hands, and disrespect for civil authority. "I'm not fond of the color red."</Synopsis>
            <Text>September, 17 N.S. 1762. A few days in Shippensburg was all Ephraim needed. On the first day, he toured the town. He was surprised to find the log stockade fort, Fort Morris. It was inactive, but represented English rule nonetheless. He learned it was built to protect this part of the Wagon road during the French &amp; Indian War after Braddock was slain. Given that many of the town's buildings, including Jeffry's house, were made of stone, it struck Ephraim oddly that the fort was wood.

The Widow's Tavern was another inducement to move on. Its clientele included trappers, traders and redcoats. Lobster backs. He needed to get further away. At least until things quieted down. Falling Springs was appealing. It had a fort, privately owned, and few settlers. It was much smaller than it used to be, which meant it may soon resettle. Ephraim worried that hostilities had only recently paused near Falling Springs. It could resume. He thought Jeffry was mad to settle so close to the wilderness with Barbara and their children.

* * *

On Tuesday before dawn, he set off for Falling Springs. It would be a long walk---about ten miles---and a less awkward farewell. He helped himself to some cold chicken, and some shillings paper his brother absentmindely left on the table the night before. His brother did not ask where he was going, so he did not tell him. _All the better._ Ephraim thought. _The fewer who knew the better._

He passed a few travelers on the road. Most were travelers. All were armed. With each mile, Ephraim felt more conspicuous wearing attire more suited for Philadelphia than the wilderness. Not a few of the travelers eyed him with suspicion or derision.

Not long before noon, he arrived in Falling Springs. As he had heard, there were more buildings than needed for the inhabitants. A good place to start over.

He made his way straight for the smith. He found it near Conococheague Creek, not far from Chamber's fort. It was odd to him that the log fort in Shippensburg filled him with more dread than Chamber's. Falling Springs oddly mirrored Shippensburg with its wooden houses and stone fort. It was as if Judge Shippen expected his settlement to withstand the test of time, and Chambers did not. Or, it could be because Shippen started earlier. Ephraim thought the war brought a lot into question.

The smith pumped the bellows as Ephraim entered. The smith's back was to the entrance, and he focused intently on his work. Ephraim set his bag down and watched quietly for a few moments. He remembered working the bellows for his dad when he was a boy. A journey towards being a blacksmith diverted to divinity by fortune. The smith was perhaps a dozen years older than Ephraim, or a bit less than that.

After a few minutes, the smith turned. He looked less surprised than he was tired. "Are you going to just stand there? What do you want?" The Scotch-Irish brogue was intelligible enough.

Ephraim hesitated at the abruptness. "I did not want to distract you from your work."

"You have. What will it be?"

Straight to the point. "I'm looking for a job. I've worked in a smithy before. You seem a little short handed."

The smith shook his head. "Maybe a few years ago. It's the damned war. Most the townsfolk have moved back to Philadelphia, or been killed."

None of this surprised Ephraim. The war lasted nearly half his life. Bradford's _Pennsylvania Journal_ reported on the atrocities. It was a fact of life. "True. But, it's gotten quieter over the past couple of years. With the Navy beating the French and Spanish in the Indies, it will be over soon."

"Prophet, are ye? It may have quieted between the English and French, but not for us and the Indians." The smith forgot the bellows. "Just the other day, we hear word that Jim Walker just escaped the savages. He made the mistake of straying too far from Fort Loudon when the bastards shot his horse and mounted it saddle on him. Had he not the knife on him, he'd have been a goner. Heard that, did ye?"

Ephraim shook his head.

"Aye. They got him back to the Indian settlement when he was left with two of them. He fetches his knife when they were both asleep." The smith pantomimed cutting tied wrists. "Just like that, he's free. One of the bastards woke and they scuffled. He grabs the savage by the hair and plunged the knife into his throat." The smith enjoyed acting out the fight. "He said the other fellow woke when he heard his friend killed, but was so scared that he ran off. Mr. Walker only two weeks ago emerged from the wilderness back to Fort Loudon. So, I don't think the settlers will be back as soon as you think."

"Where's Fort Loudon?"

The smith motions over Ephraim's shoulder. "Off that way about a day's ride."

Ephraim concluded "that way" was further to the West. "When were they last here?"

"A few years. We haven't but one in ten that we had here when the war started. Ben plans to lay out a proper town at some point. Maybe then---"

"Then you need help."

The smith sighed. "When there's a town, yes. But that won't be for years."

"I need the work. Not for wages. Just to get on my feet and head down the road."

"To Fort Pitt?"

"No, down to Virginia, perhaps."

"Aye, perhaps. What's in Virginia?"

"My business."

"You got a name?"

Ephraim hesitated. The last thing he wanted was his name to attract attention. "Jeffry."

"Jeffry what?"

"Boydell." It came out of his mouth before he could think. Now he had to commit to it. "Jeffry Boydell."

"You're a dandy, Mister Boydell. I mean, look at you. Nobody dresses like that out here."

Ephraim looked down at his suit. It fit Philadelphia fashion with its skin tight breeches buckled at the knee. He had loosened the fitted blue waistcoat during the walk from Shippensburg, but the neckerchief hid that. The gold embroidery and buttons did stand out. The Smith's breeches were similar, albeit black, with a looser fitting brown waistcoat. None of the ruffles, embroidery or non-functional buttons.

"No way you're working in that. You've not worked a rough day in your life."

"My father was a smith, I'll have you know." He made a point of changing his accent a bit. He tried to sound rougher. "I 'prentised under him. I can work the bellows. I can do most of the work you would expect if you had a 'prentise. You're doing work you oughtn't do if you're the master smith. I can't do much about the suit. But, you can't judge a book by its cover."

"Humph." The smith considered Ephraim for a few moments. "Go on. Let me see your hands."

Ephraim held his hands out.

The smith grabbed the hand, and turned it palm up and back to palm down. "Not a dandy's hands. I'll give you that. Not quite rough, but not dainty. They've seen some work."

"As I said, I 'prentised under my father. He wanted something better of me and my brother. Don't let my attire deceive you. I can do just about everything you need."

"Everything, eh? We'll see about that. It would do to have a lighter load. I'll try you on and see if this works out, Mister Boydell. But, if you've not proved your metal by week's end, away with ya."

Ephraim noted the bite in the smith's warning. He thought back to the hot, sweaty days as a young boy. It just occurred to him that he may not be in the best shape to swing a hammer. He had to try. "There's something more?"

"Aye?"

"I'll need some place to stay." He lifted his bag. "All that I have is here."

"Och. There it is. Did you think that didn't occur to me, lad? Here I thought you've lived here in Falling Springs me whole life and I just now laid eyes on you. You're a daft one that." He motioned toward a ladder at the back of the shop, then pointed up. "There's the loft, for services rendered. But, until then, get this fire going again. I'm going for a piss."</Text>

            <Title>NIJ Ballistic Levels Protection</Title>
            <Text>NIJ Ballistic Levels Protection

( Level IIA, Level II, Level IIIA, Level III and Level IV)

Body armor is a critical safety piece of safety equipment that has saved the lives of thousands of people. However people who are in the market for body armor often find it difficult to assess which choice is right for them. There are a few primary factors to consider which solution will best suit their needs; threat level, heat buildup, comfort, mobility conceal-ability and cost. Threat level or protection level is typically the biggest factor when choosing body armor, and also the most difficult aspect to understand.

The U.S. National Institute of Justice (NIJ) has established and updated minimum performance stands for body armor to ensure that users will know what their body armor will protect them from. The NIJ classifies body armor into 5 different threat levels:

Level IIA, Level II, Level IIIA, Level III and Level IV; based on their ability to stop specified rounds at specified velocities. The current standard is NIJ 101.06. Also please note that while a higher level generally means protection against more powerful rounds, it does not account for other factors such as weight, or multi-hit capability. Because of this it is suggested that you choose body armor that is right for the situation and not the one that is the highest level.

 NIJ Level IIA

NIJ Level IIA armor is typically soft body armor, meaning that it is composed of layers of high-strength woven fibers. Common types of these fibers are aramid fibers such as Kevlar, Twaron, and Goldflex or Polyethylene fibers such as Spectra and Dyneema. Level IIA is designed to stop a .9mm FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) round at a speed of ~1165 feet per second (ft/s) and a .40 S&amp;W FMJ at 1065 ft/s. Most often found in soft body armor vests, Level IIA is usually the lightest, most flexible, most comfortable and easiest to conceal.

 NIJ Level II

A step above Level IIA is Level II which is also most commonly soft body armor. Level II is designed to protect from .9mm FMJ traveling at a speed of ~1245 ft/s and a .357 Magnum JSP (Jacketed Soft Point) at ~1,430 ft/s. Like IIA, Level II body armor is typically very light, comfortable and easy to conceal, however it provides significantly more protection against blunt force trauma (trauma caused by kinetic energy of the round hitting the plate or vest.) Because of this factor most concealable body armor vests are either Level II or Level IIIA, with Level IIA falling largely out of date.

 NIJ Level IIIA

Level IIIA is designed to stop .357 Sig FMJ FN (Flat Nose) bullets traveling at a velocity of ~1470 ft/s and .44 Magnum SJHP (Semi Jacketed Hollow Point) rounds at a velocity of 1430 ft/s. Like its level IIA and Level II, Level IIIA is most commonly soft armor, however hard armor plates and ballistic shields can sometimes be found with a rating of level IIIA.

 NIJ Level III

At level III, we transition to soft body armor vests to the world of ballistic plate levels. Ballistic body armor plates are also referred to as rifle plates or hard armor plates. Level III rifle plates are designed to stop 6 spaced hits of 7.62x51mm NATO FMJ (U.S. Military designation M80) at a velocity of ~2780 ft/s, which is very similar to the .308 Winchester round often used in hunting. Some manufacturers (ourselves included) also offer hard armor rifle plates that are referred to as level III+. While the NIJ does not recognize the rating of level III+, these plates typically have the + to indicate that they stop the same rounds at higher velocities or to indicate protect from NIJ threat level III plus additional threats such as M855 and M193. Level III and III+ body armor plates can be found at a variety of different price points depending on the rifle plate’s weight and material. The cheapest and heaviest of these options are typically steel body armor plates which can weigh anywhere from 8-10 lbs depending on the size of the plate. While more expensive options such as those made from Polyethylene or ceramic, can weigh as little as 3 pounds.

 NIJ Level IV

Level IV ballistic plates are the highest rated hard armor plates under NIJ 101.06 standards. These hard armor plates were designed to take 1 hit from an armor-piercing rifle. These rifle plates are tested to defeat 7.62MM armor piercing (AP) bullets (also known was .30-06 or 30 ot 6) traveling at a velocity of 2880 ft/s. Please note that since level IV ballistic plates are only tested to stop 1 shot compared to 6 shots from a level III hard armor plate, a level IV hard armor plate is not always better than a level III hard armor plate. Besides NIJ certification there are other standards of bullet resistance such as the U.S. Military’s SAPI (Small Arms Protective Insert) standards, which features plates designed to military specifications. This standard first came into play with their Interceptor body armor (IBA), and later with their Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) and the Modular Tactical Vest (MTV). Since 2005, they have moved to the ESAPI (Enhanced SAPI) Program. There are also what are referred to as Special Threats plates which are designed to stop common threats while minimizing weight and cost. Typically examples of these plates are AK-47 and AR-15 plates.

### America is Still a Colony

If there was a failed revolution, then it's quite likely that the colonies will have suffered some sort of harsh reprisals, and may still be living under some sort of [stern martial law](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppressiveStatesOfAmerica). In this case, expect to find [La Résistance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance) going strong.

The colonists will often retain stereotypically British traits, such as accentsnote , even though those traits were not actually affected by the war, but by distance, and, in many cases, were already somewhat established by the time the war occurred. This may be done to help remind the viewer that things are different in this timeline, or it may simply be [Rule of Funny](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny).

In any case, expect mention of [Historical Domain Characters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter) like [George Washington](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington), [Thomas Jefferson](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThomasJefferson), and [Benjamin Franklin](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin), in much different roles from the ones they played in our history. They may be branded as traitors, or simply remembered for much different things.note  Benedict Arnold's name will no longer be a synonym for [Turncoat](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Turncoat), and may even be a term of praise.

            <Text>#### Faster-than-Light Travel Physics via Wormholes

Faster-than-light travel is possible via wormholes, known as Slipstreams. IRL, wormholes are a scientific conjecture, derived from the same equations that describe black holes. We cannot conceive of how to get to or use a wormhole. In **Strand**, however, wormholes are a convenient means of travel from one place to another. People traverse wormholes using a Jump drive, with each wormhole connecting between only two locations. Travel time is near instantaneous for the jumping ship and its occupants.

A Slipknot is the term used by Toltecs and adopted by English (Laufknoten in German, Trou de Biche (tru-de-beesh) in French, Hueco in Spanish, Orifício in Portuguese).

### Knight in Sour Armor

When life gives you lemons...note

The world is filled with [Wide Eyed Idealists][8qlXdrXV] who believe in truth and justice and devote their lives to fighting for it. And then the [dark, cruel and brutal world][HgZAHQwy] keeps letting them down. For them, [Being Good Sucks][dV0aRfOr]. But rather than giving up on their goals, they choose to fight not because they believe they will truly make a difference, but because it's the right thing to do.

More often than not these characters are in settings that feature [Black and Gray Morality][BZ8YPyYo]. They're usually [survivors][F1JC6UKc] who have largely given up on believing in [Honor Before Reason][zftkt4Cy], but still strive to be [Lawful Good][f5mIyKpa] or as close to it as reality allows them to be. They are willing to bend the rules to save them. In [Lighter and Softer][S2sd1dfx] settings, these characters are [Grumpy Bears][a5wv40EX] and are often mocked by the other characters for being so sour all the time.

The presence of cynicism usually makes the [idealistic behavior even more noteworthy][hbNCMm5g]: it's easy to [love everyone][5RC1DOhN] when [Rousseau Was Right][m4QP5DTD], but you really have to be a good guy to believe that [Humans Are Bastards][X2OujTPk] and care about them anyway. Such characters can also be [The Fettered][oB6Qv0O1]; their cynical outlook tells them they could probably get away with all kinds of things that they don't do because [that would be wrong][YiWekhmg], and just because the world sucks doesn't mean you need to make it worse. Then again, this kind of character goes great with a world where you [Earn Your Happy Ending][g7geU5za] after much strife.

This is the inverse of the worldview of most [Well Intentioned Extremists][uNobssij], especially those who believe that [Utopia Justifies the Means][ZlNsbTKF]. Extremists or [Knight Templars][LBLA1LAs] may *believe* themselves to be this, but their actions are far too extreme. A Knight In Sour Armor believes in the rules and breaks them only when absolutely necessary, which is very rarely; not surprisingly, many have taken a [Heroic Vow][zKfqKOhU] related to this behavior. Often has a personal set of rules, trimmed down to those that really *matter* in order to minimize conflicts and distractions. Contributes to the Knight's gruff tendencies, since politeness tends to appear a lot further down the priority list than feeding orphans and so on.

Generally, these characters fit one of two personality types. Members of the first type are former [Wide Eyed Idealists][8qlXdrXV] who have come to [accept][oqMjL1xW] that their world is on the low end of the [Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism][vUa4vRV3], but who [still find something beautiful in their former ideals][hbNCMm5g] that they want to hold on to. Those of the second type are born cynics, who would make natural [Jerkass][2divM9bt] [antiheroes][vxmPUXur], but who nevertheless have devoted themselves to a code of honor or fair play. In either case, these people tend to have gone through (often painful) [Character Development][K894pePb] in their past, meaning that they are normally older than the average hero.

Either way, however, the effect is basically the same: you have a [Knight in Shining Armor][WIcvpSWM] wearing [Jade-Colored Glasses][oqMjL1xW]; the difference between the first and second types is which comes first.

These characters show up often in [Film Noir][fXmH1ST4], [Dark Fantasy][TnijeCWW], and [Low Fantasy][0sYzfdfX]. Law enforcement is a particularly attractive career, but the Knight in Sour Armor will usually hold back from becoming a [Cowboy Cop][nx27V3sG]. Very frequently, they end up as [The Mentor][lLEUEl8N], a [Grumpy Bear][a5wv40EX] with [Jade-Colored Glasses][oqMjL1xW], [The Last DJ][sYp83NmF], or a [Cool Old Guy][HQBcDNzo] if they last long enough. As teammates, they are often the [Sour Supporter][claGLKPs]. They also frequently end up as [Hero Antagonists][IHFoMqvc] and extreme [Woobies][qYnrrcMR]. This is often the final state of [The Atoner][Nq5flFlZ] post-[Heel–Face Turn][4B6daVlk]. Despite their cynicism, they behave like [The Anti-Nihilist][9n5Fx4uu].

Will often overlap with [The Snark Knight][UzouGqDL]. Compare [Angst? What Angst?][jsb8QcVT], for characters who take the [troubles of a good alignment][dV0aRfOr] with far less complaint; [Noble Demon][Rir5C6LI], who will [proudly declare themselves evil][pCoZZ6GI], but still finds themselves doing good once in a while; [Sour Outside, Sad Inside][KASXPX9J], for characters who sour attitude hides the fact they're sad; and [Jerkass Woobie][ZpecAgEQ], who spits in the face of the [alignment][IqutvgvQ] chart. Converted [Silly Rabbit, Idealism Is for Kids!][ViqwaLip] or [Good Is Old-Fashioned][q4RZfAog] believers may well find themselves becoming this trope if the heroes can bring them around. If they don't like idealism, but don't like cynicism, either, then you also have a touch of [Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers!][nBuyD2KU]

#### Knight in Sour Armor / Playing With

**Basic Trope**: A cynical character who is nevertheless [obstinately good][HAdZYHjX].

- **Straight**: Alice [Lime][h2Gj56UI] is an experienced police detective who honestly expects most of her cases to end [in tragedy][y1AhbVbG]... [but not for lack of trying][hM1P6s0q].
- **Exaggerated**: Alice is an [Iron Woobie][eVXthZl3] who is constantly undermined by those around her.
- **Justified**:
    - As a cop Alice has witnessed [Police Brutality][iV7lWYSa] and racial profiling, dealt with scumbag murderers and rapists, and on top that people hate her and assume she's a [Corrupt Cop][Y4WzIwXu] just because she's a cop.
    - Alice might think she lives in a [Crapsack World][HgZAHQwy], but also thinks that being [Good Feels Good][9Wyhkh7Q] even though it might [suck][dV0aRfOr] from time to time.
    - Alice might be cynical and think things will turn out for the worst, but she knows that there's still a chance that she's wrong and something good might happen.
    - Alice isn't fond of the state of the world, but that's all the more reason not to take it lying down, even if nobody else gives a shit.
- **Inverted**: Alice is an up-and-running villain filled with idealistic zeal of how easily she's going to [Take Over the World][2Y1WKwIb].
- **Double Subverted**:
    - ...and so is [everyone else][ePb4Qdur]. It's more suspicious if you *aren't*. Alice's bribes are voluntary payments from people grateful she actually did her job.
- **Zig Zagged**: The framing was actually a lie fabricated by Alice in order to hide her [True Colors][wVx1Urh1]. Which, in itself, was a lie to preserve her cover.
- **Averted**:
    - Alice is heroic, cheerful and optimistic.
    - Alice is cynical and doesn't bother to fight on.
- **Lampshaded**: "Why do you fight so hard if you know you're just going to lose?" "Things are bad enough already. I'm not letting them get worse."
- **Exploited**: Alice is assigned the case because the criminals are more likely to [mistake her for someone who can be bribed][JqmDP8vu].
- **Defied**: Whenever depression threatens, Alice remembers all the cases she closed successfully.
- **Discussed**: "Let me tell you right now — I would rather have Det. Lime investigating my murder than any wet-behind-the-ears [Wide-Eyed Idealist][8qlXdrXV] who thinks every criminal is always caught."
- **Conversed**: "You know, for a character as cynical as Det. Lime, she seems to be awfully heroic."
- **Deconstructed**:
    - Alternatively, she continues to protect a [Crapsack World][HgZAHQwy], not because it's the right thing to do, but because she's a [Blood Knight][okZ0VNnE] who thrives on conflict.
    - Alice's cynicism drives more idealistic folk away from her due to being [excessively bitter][oqMjL1xW] whilst other cynics scorn her for futilely trying to help people.
- **Reconstructed**: While she enjoys the warm fuzzies from fighting the good fight, she still goes into every case without expectations.
- **Played For Drama**: Alice gets her ideas thrown back in her face by a [Knight Templar][LBLA1LAs] or [Fallen Hero][mtmzpmft] who shares the same cynical beliefs as she does, forcing her to confront her own ideas and see how her attitude could create the same problems she despises.
- **Implied**: Alice goes into a rant about how the world is a [Crapsack World][HgZAHQwy]. When someone asks her why she fights, Alice gives them a meaningful look, but we don't see what she said.

The [Knight In Sour Armor][c2tY4vKt] is over here, ya goof... why do I even bother sometimes (mutter mutter)...

&gt; &gt; —Auron, Final Fantasy X

&gt; Taylor: Everything I’ve said in the past stands. Humans are idiots. They’re selfish and injust and unfair, they’re violent and clumsy and petty and shortsighted. Don’t get me wrong. Every part of that applies to me, too. I’m not setting myself above them on any level. But at the end of the day, sometimes humanity isn’t so bad.

&gt; Jon Snow: I don't know how to do that. I thought I did...but I failed.
&gt; Davos Seaworth: Good. Now go fail again.
&gt; — Game of Thrones, "Oathbreaker"

&gt; Matt Farrell: Then why you doing this?
&gt; John McClane: Because there's nobody else to do it right now, that's why. Believe me, if there were somebody else to do it, I'd let them do it, but there's not. So we're doing it.
&gt; —Live Free or Die Hard

&gt; Liara: So tell me, Shepard, what are you fighting for?

&gt; —Mass Effect 2

&gt; I'm no hero. Never was, never will be. Just an old killer, hired to do some wet-work.
&gt; — Solid Snake, Metal Gear Solid

&gt; Do not be deceived, Wormwood. [Satan's] cause is never more in danger, than when a human, no longer desiring, but intending, to do our Enemy [God]'s will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.
&gt; — The Demon Screwtape, The Screwtape Letters

&gt; The future is an inherently good thing. And we move into it one winter at a time. Things get better one winter at a time. If you're going to celebrate anything, then have a drink on this: The world is, generally and on balance, a better place to live this year than it was last year.
&gt; — Spider Jerusalem, Transmetropolitan

&gt; Hey! Mother Theresa! I was gonna do it anyway. I just hate being lectured.

&gt; — Red Dead Redemption

&gt; Arthur: I did build a stronghold. Kaamelott, they call it. I sought and hired knights in the whole kingdom; in Caledonia, in Carmelid, in Gaunes, in Vannes, in Wales; I ordered a big table, to have the knights sitting together; I ordered it round, to prevent having a knight sitting in a corner, or at the end of it; it was complicated, so I tried to explain what was the Grail, to make sure everyone understand; it was hard, so I tried to laugh, to make sure nobody got bored; I failed; but I don't want anyone to say that I did nothing. Because it's not true.
&gt; — Kaamelott

&gt; Renate: A Knight in Shining Armor did nothing for nobody. He never fought. A knight in dented, scraped armor, now that's what you want.
&gt; — Nancy Drew: The Haunting of Castle Malloy

&gt; Nicodemus: Such as why you chose this kind of life for yourself. To appoint yourself protector of mortal kind, and to make yourself the enemy of any who would do them harm. To live outcast from your own kind, laughed at and mocked by most mortals. Living in a hovel, barely scraping by. Spurning wealth and fame. Why do you do it?
&gt; Harry Dresden: I'm a disciple of the Tao of Peter Parker, obviously.
&gt; — The Dresden Files: Death Masks

&gt; Tough cop, whore from the slums, true love&gt; —love that overcomes a powerful curse. A fairy tale... In a world dominated by scorn and meanness, a world full of bandits and murderers, true love can &gt; still work wonders. Lost causes are worth the struggle. A fairy tale...
&gt; — Geralt, The Witcher

&gt; A sword is a weapon. The art of swordsmanship is learning how to kill. That is the truth. What Miss Kaoru says is sweet and innocent talk that only those whose hands have never been stained with the blood of men can believe. But to tell you the truth, I much prefer Miss Kaoru's sweet and innocent talk over the truth, that I do.
&gt; — Himura Kenshin, Rurouni Kenshin

&gt; Word of advice, Ressler. This work we perform, it does not serve to look backward. This city (London), wickedness will ever leave its spores here. You and I, we are not magicians. We cannot see through walls or into men's minds. Dozens perished but hundreds who were ill are now well once more. We fight. Well fight with all the skills we may muster. Beyond that, we may do no more.
&gt; — Edmund Reid, Ripper Street

&gt; "Stop that," he says. "That pseudo-mysterious omnipotent voice might trick the soccer moms at the local Renaissance fair, but due to my inherent cynicism it's going to take a hell of a show to convince me."
&gt; "Oh, no," she says. "You, Mr. Vantas, are a fake cynic, the worst and most tragic kind."
&gt; — The fic look up, look up

&gt; "Hey! I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out. You and me, once and for all. "Winning?" Is that what you think it’s about? I'm not trying to win. I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, because I hate someone, or because I want to blame someone. It's not because it's fun. God knows it's not because it's easy. It's not even because it works because it hardly ever does. I do what I do because it's right! Because it's decent! And above all, it's kind! It's just that... Just kind. If I run away today, good people will die. If I stand and fight, some of them might live. Maybe not many, maybe not for long. Hey, you know, maybe there's no point to any of this at all. But it's the best I can do. So I'm going to do it. And I'm going to stand here doing it until it kills me. And you're going to die too! Some day... And how will that be? Have you thought about it? What would you die for? Who I am is where I stand. Where I stand is where I fall. Stand with me. These people are terrified. Maybe we can help a little. Why not, just at the end, just be kind?"
&gt; — The Twelfth Doctor, "The Doctor Falls"

&gt; "I don't know any of you. But that doesn't matter, does it? My family: the family you demonized and excommunicated, has fought and died through generations for this country. We do this thing... for Wallachia, and her people. We don't have to know you all. We do it anyway. And it's not the dying that frightens us; it's never having stood up and fought for you. I'm Trevor Belmont. Of the House of Belmont. And dying... has never frightened me."
&gt; —Trevor Belmont, Castlevania (2017)

&gt; "And yeah, it's a shit, shit world, but you know what? Good things are done every day. Just not, apparently, by you."
&gt; — Maddie Bowen, Blood Diamond

&gt; "If I let everyone I thought was an idiot die, then there wouldn't be very many people left, would there?"
&gt; — Gilgamesh Wulfenbach, Girl Genius

&gt; Harry: "Morgan, what the hell are you doing?"
&gt; Morgan: "My duty. I've always known that it might call for me to give up my life to protect the Council. And so it has."
&gt; Harry: "Morgan..."
&gt; Morgan: "You did your best. Despite everything that has gone between us. You put yourself to the hazard again and again for my sake. It was a worthy effort. But it just wasn't to be. No shame in that. You'll learn, if you live long enough. You never win them all."
&gt; See, here's the thing. Morgan was right: you can't win them all. But that doesn't mean you give up. Not ever. Morgan never said that part - he was too busy living it.
&gt; — The Dresden Files, Turn Coat

&gt; Judy Hopps: I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it.
&gt; Chief Bogo: Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps. The world has always been broken. That's why we need good cops... like you.
&gt; —Zootopia

            <Title>Ephraim rejected by brother</Title>
            <Synopsis>EPHRAIM BIGGS is a Son of Liberty on the lamb. In the rain, he arrives at his brother's JEFFRY BIGGS home in SHIPPENSBERG, PA. Once inside and warmed, he asks his brother to shelter him. In the conversation, they argue over why he was there, which leads into the Sons of Liberty and the real reason why Ephraim is on the run. He refuses his brother, and the next morning Ephraim leaves.

</Synopsis>
            <Text>**September, 14 N.S. 1762.** It was a dark and stormy night. Ephraim Biggs stood under the building's eave as rivulets of rain poured over its edge. Between lightening flashes, he could see the lane ahead. Puddles of brown rain collected and formed a small stream. _Four more doors._

Ephraim hued up and bolted down the lane. A nearby bolt of lightening flashed and thunder roared at the same time. The nearness scared him. He dove down, into a mud puddle. As suddenly as the lightening came, Ephraim felt foolish for jumping into the mud.

He stood and shook himself off. He picked up his bag and continued down the lane. After two steps, he stopped. Mud on his face oozed toward his eyes. He looked up into the rain, letting the water help him wash the mud from his face away.

Soaked to the bone, he stopped running down the lane. It was a cold, dark rain, but in a few minutes he would be warm and dry.

&lt;!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shippensburg,_Pennsylvania --&gt;
He walked up to the house that the Widow Piper's Tavern keeper said belonged to Jeffry Biggs. Light cracked through the shutters signaling they were still awake. He straightened his coat. With his fist, he pounded on the door. He waited a few moments, then repeated his pounding.

The door opened. Jeffry Biggs pointed a flintlock pistol at Ephraim. "Who is it?"

Ephraim looked at the pistol. It was at half-cock, the primer pan down. "Your brother, Jeffry."

"I don't have a brother named Jeffry."

"Don't be an ass. It's me, Ephraim."

Jeffry hesitated before tilting the pistol up. He grabbed the hammer with his thumb and decocked the pistol. Ephraim flinched. It was a bad habit their father taught both of them. At least he pointed the barrel away safely. "Not like that."

&lt;!-- https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20141020061334AAujVoR --&gt;

Ephraim removed his hat before he crossed the threshold. He shook the rain off of it. He handed it over to Jeffry. He then took off his long coat, still covered in mud.

Jeffry motioned to a chair on the porch. "Leave that on the chair. We'll take care of that in the morning."

Ephraim lay the coat across the chair's arms. He looked back at his brother to see if there was anything else he needed to do.

"Enter."

Ephraim crossed the threshold. The house was warm. The faint wood smoke at the fire coaxed Ephraim to relax for the first time in a week.

"Barbara, would you mind warming up some soup?"

Jeffry's wife Barbara set down her needlework. "Certainly. Good evening, Ephraim." As she stood, Ephraim noticed the slight bulge that would be a new niece or nephew. He was there when their first was stillborn. Peggy and Jeffry junior would be asleep upstairs.

He started to shiver. "Evening." Without asking, he moved a nearby three-legged stool closer to the fire and sat.

"Do you need a blanket?" she said.

He shook his head. "Rum?"

Jeffry said, "I'll get that." He went to a cabinet to get a mug and the rum.

Barbara moved a near-empty pot of soup back onto the fire. "We just finished a short while ago, so it won't take long."

Jeffry handed the rum to Ephraim, and stood back. Ephraim could feel the---it was not quite a glare or a stare. It was that annoyed look Jeffry had when they were younger. It was a familiar look. Ephraim preferred to sip the rum to warm him and let the fire slowly dry him.

After a bit, Jeffry sat at the table. He put his glasses and picked up his quill and started reading. He made notes as he went. Every few moments, he would pause and glance toward Ephraim before returning to his work.

Barbara gave Ephraim some soup, then resumed her needlework.

It remained quiet for quite some time. Ephraim finished the soup and milked the rum. His clothes dried up. Most of the mud was on the longcoat on the porch.

Jeffry set down the papers, quill and glasses. "Alright, what's all this?"

Ephraim noted frustration and exasperation in his voice.
Ephraim took another sip of rum to buy a few more seconds. He thought through what he had rehearsed en route. He never found a way to make it sound less incriminating.

"I need a place to stay a while."

"You have a place. Philadelphia."

"I'm thinking of moving West a bit. Philadelphia is a bit too modern. Right? That's why you left."

"I left because there were too many lawyers there, and not enough here. As soon as the wilderness is opened up they will need lawyers."

Ephraim mumbled, "people go West to avoid lawyers."

"What's that?"

"I said that's very enterprising of you. I'm sure Pennsylvanians will find comfort in knowing the law is with them in the wilderness. Maybe you can lawyer your way into subduing the savages."

"You mean the Shawnee? The Cherokee? Many of them are adopting our modes of dress and law. Some are starting to write in their own language. Being out here--I think I can help subdue the savages with the law, as you say." Jeffry poured rum into his own mug, then poured some into Ephraim's.

"Don't you think they would be happier if we stayed where we were and minded our own business?"

Jeffry laughed. "I don't right care what they prefer. Locke was right, if they were the rightful owners of this land, it would be prosperous like England. Instead, they left it a wasteland. We English are more enterprising. We will subdue the Earth as divine law decreed. My way is more civil. Would you rather they adopt English law or French?"

"You know I don't care one way or the other."

"Right, you don't even agree with the appeal to divine law."

It was a subtle barb, and one that did not get through Ephraim's skin. "I learned all about God I needed in seminary. Look, I need a place to stay for while."

"Why not Philadelphia? You had a place there. You had one in New York before that. New Haven was your home for a time before that. I don't think you have a home here."

"I'm not looking for a home. Just a place to stay while I find a home. I don't think these crossroads are where I will end up. Although, I did not see a smith."

Jeffry clinched his jaw. "There is a smith, and he barely makes ends meet. Getty's tavern brings most of his work. I don't think another smith is what this place needs."

"I don't think this place could handle two Biggs, either."

Jeffry smirked, "it's Bigg enough with one. Don't be coy."

Ephraim feigned innocence. It was an old joke.

"Why are you really here?"

Ephraim finished his rum. "I just need to get away from Philadelphia, that's all."

Jeffry glared at him, just like their father used to. "I will let you stay a few days. After that, you should continue down Wagon Road."

            <Title>1763-1783: Point of Divergence</Title>
            <Text>From the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until the end of the Seven Year's War of 1763, a philosophical and political rift occurred both in America and Britain. Americans viewed Locke's Second Treatise of Government as a blueprint for social change. The British viewed it as wasted paper. Benign neglect from the 1720s to 1740s resulted in colonists assuming more control for their affairs; home rule _de jure_. This neglect was shattered during the Seven Year's War, but Americans exploited the crisis with their more sophisticated understanding of politics and emerged from the War debt-free and ready to assert its independence. In England, Parliament weakened the Crown's control over politics and the prerogative system, nearly reducing the Crown to a figurehead. George III subverted that trend by taking control of Parliament in the years between his coronation in 1760 and the end of the War in 1763.

Saddled with war debt and the need to protect North America, George's Parliament enacted the Sugar Act, which reduced the tax on molasses. Americans rioted and decried this as an intrusion into its home rule. The period known as the American Troubles (1763-67) were pivotal in stabilizing British-American relations and establishing the modern British Commonwealth.
During the Troubles, Crown and Parliament exploited American internecine jealousies and prejudices to prevent this strain from flaring into mutiny. George recognized the threat to stability and had Parliament invite American colonies to send delegates to negotiate. An agreement similar to the earlier home rule "Albany Plan" pitched by Benjamin Franklin in 1755 was agreed upon. The Stamp Act of 1765 &amp; Declaratory Act of 1766 never occur. Timelines diverge.[^OTL-American-Troubles]

[^OTL-American-Troubles]: OTL: The watershed period from 1763-1767 divided America and Britain. The Proclamation in 1763, the Sugar Act in 1764, Stamp Act of 1765 and its repeal / Declaratory Act of 1766 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 progressively strained and broke relations. As cold hostilities turned to hot war, moderates sought to halt the separation until by the 1777 Battle of Saratoga it became clear no reunification was possible.

Toltec weaponry thwarted Pontiac's Rebellion in Summer of 1763, which prevented the Declaratory Act from being enacted. Instead, King George sends a full regiment to ensure the Ohio is retained and negotiations for American home rule started. REMOVE

In 1765, Parliament invited a delegation from each of the mainland colonies to work out differences that included Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. This extended negotiation (1765-68) blunted Radical demands for independence. However, a splinter from the Sons of Liberty continued the (now unpopular) fight for American Independence. This splinter movement is a key area of conflict in Discovery Season.

These negotiations led to legislation that addressed British North America grievances and allowed both sides of the Atlantic to move forward in a tense harmony.

#### Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769

The Rights of Englishmen Act of 1769 extended all customary rights &amp; privileges to native-English speaking white settlers in British North America. This created some frustration with Caribbean Colonials. Many Caribbean colonists remedied this by establishing residence in Charles Town, Carolina. However, this addressed the IRL complaints of colonialists that they were not treated to the rights they would have enjoyed had they remained home.

This disenfranchised French-Canadian residents as their native language was French. Many raised their children speaking English to extend these rights to them.

#### British North America Act of 1771

British North America sought representation in Parliament. The government agreed, providing the colonies restructured. This act transformed the continental colonies to six self-regulated provinces:
Canada,
New England (some called Camelot),
Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York),
Virginia (includes Maryland &amp; Delaware),
Carolina,
&amp; Georgia.
This act further gave those provincial governments representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Charlotina province is added in 1803, encompassing IRL Northwest Territory United States. Parliament calculated this reorganization of the colonies into provinces would create internal tension that would allow England to retain control.

This created frustration among the joined colonies (NY, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island &amp; Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New Hampshire), especially RI&amp;PP as they sought to be more tolerant religiously than Massachusetts. This is an example of Parliament's intentional friction within the provinces.

#### Rights of Religious Liberty Act of 1772

British North America sought religious liberty. Parliament sought its debts to be paid and taxation for its recurring budget. Some of this budget paid Anglican ministerial salaries. This act permitted provinces to manage their own religious affairs. This effectively abolishes the Anglican church in British North America except for Virginia and Carolina. Thus liberty was a province matter, instead of individual. The lack of Anglican minsters removes British North America's obligation to pay that portion of the budget. British North America provinces are allowed to establish their own state religions.
Virginia and Carolina remained Anglican.
Canada was not allowed to have Catholics in government, but was otherwise Catholic territory.
New England became officially Congregationalist (Puritan). Though the power of puritanism lapsed a generation before, there is still enough friction between the denominations.
Pennsylvania extended its religious tolerance through New York, making it a bastion for downtrodden faiths.

#### War Debt Equity Act of 1772

In the _quid pro quo_ for the Rights of Religious Liberty Act, British North America provinces agreed to take on half of the Government's debt incurred by the end of the French &amp; Indian War. Whether this meant war debt or total debt was a matter of disagreement that was settled during the Napoleonic Era. The Seven Years' War nearly doubled Great Britain's national debt, so the question of whether British North America provinces accepted a quarter or half of the debt was no small issue. Buried in this act was the liquidation of various debts by prominent members of British North America society. This pushed the Sons of Liberty into the fringe by bribing the elite.

### Central Theme

Stories were first told for two reasons: entertainment and education. [The Epic of Gilgamesh](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh) was the story of a hero who kicked ass and took names, but it was also a celebration of the culture that produced it, one of the first.

Different from [An Aesop](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop) in that the [Central Theme](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme) is often a question or a general topic rather than a direct precept or conclusion: where an Aesop is a specific moral that is explicated and forced on the audience, a Central Theme will more likely be explored, analyzed, and [Played With](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith). For example, "[The Power of Friendship](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship)" or (even better) "The struggles of sustaining The Power of Friendship [in a cold, harsh world](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld)" are themes in that they are questions or issues that the author is interested in exploring and/or wants the reader to think about, whereas "The Power of Friendship will ultimately overcome all obstacles" is an Aesop in that it is a lesson or conclusion the author wants the reader to take away from the work. Of course, there can be a fine line between them, and the central theme can and often is used to develop and deliver the Aesop, but they are not strictly speaking the same.

Using our example above as a demonstration, the writer may have constructed a story that examines the difficulties of sustaining The Power of Friendship in a cold, harsh world (theme), only to ultimately reach the conclusion that The Power of Friendship will always prevail (Aesop). The reader may disagree with the author's conclusion, but regardless, the work will still be about the difficulties of sustaining The Power of Friendship, and there's nothing the reader can do to change that.

Put simply, the Aesop is the what the author wants the reader to *learn*. The Central Theme is what the story is fundamentally *about*.

Also compare [Motif](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Motif), a more general term for a recurring [symbol](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Symbolism) or idea throughout a work, different from Central Theme in that it is not the story's main focus. Another distinction is that a Central Theme is *usually* a broad, expansive topic—love, time, mortality—while Motifs are generally smaller and more specific.

A good place to start thinking about the theme of the work is the conflict it depicts; what is the overall conflict of the story, where does it originate, and what questions or thinking points does this conflict prompt?

Go to a work's [Analysis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Analysis) sub-page to find a more detailed exploration of its central theme — or add your own insight. As always, however, be wary of [seeing messages where there are none](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotDidactic).

            <Text>&lt;!-- concept-overview --&gt;
**Strand** is  a [low fantasy], [Type-X] [alternative-history] series written by Ben Wilson.

In the 18th Century, British-Americans uncover an [ancient acropolis] that introduces ([advanced, ancient human]) [lost technology] in the Ohio Territory at the end of the Seven Years' War. This leads to [America remaining in the UK] despite continued struggle by the Sons of Liberty. Britain becomes a [low culture, high tech] society. We have a faction (SOL) who want to divide, and a faction (Tory) who want to unite; both want to control the strange tech, but ultimately come together to keep it from the French &amp; Indians.

Throughout the 19th Century, a secret British society reverse-engineers the [Neutrinovoltaic power][phlebotinum]. This increases degrees of separation between Britain and the rest of the world, creating a [decade dissonance]. A technological espionage struggle ensues among the great powers. The Napoleonic &amp; Crimean wars occur per OTL, but with different outcomes. British North America starts its Western expansion, leading to the Mexican war, which becomes British.

By the 20th Century, technological equilibrium is established with Britain replicating its IRL trade dominance benefiting Europe. The UK re-invents slipstream travel, with Albert Strand ultimately strand on Elysion and trying to get home. Belize becomes the launch region for space travel.

In Strand Series, we explore the perennial struggle of a society when its technological capabilities out-strips its morality. Most Americans do not understand the technology they use. Nor are they interested in its long-term implications. We also explore the tension between centralism/de-centralism, individualism, etc. As religion was a significant part of society, Christianity will be explored in a manner non-threatening to the reader.

We also explain how American remaining a part of Great Britain would not have hindered our global dominance. But, what about the Bill of Rights &amp; Constitution?

### Being Good Sucks

If being good were as easy as most cartoons make it out to be, everyone would be a saint. [Truth is][1SsCHjx9], sometimes Being Good Sucks. Doing the right thing doesn't always [feel good][IUc9rR1y], is hard to pull off, can be painful, sometimes even harmful, to yourself and others. Being good requires a [Heroic Sacrifice][2KZ7vTLA], [keeping your word][5KQmQ02G], and thinking of others before yourself. It means swallowing your [pride][02D0Ewh3], [owning up to][xpCP34xn] and apologizing for your mistakes. It means doing the above without expecting a reward (even a spoken [thank you][7og7AiOH]), [refusing one if offered][VomOnC6U]—and most ego-crushing—[accepting the punishment for being good][BW1IsYBy].

The variations are endless, but below is a condensed catalog:

- Sacrificing your own happiness: It can be any type of happiness, be it [denying romance to protect][wYaAKJi7] the [Love Interest][5vg6yO0U], or where their quest [To Be a Master][B7ZllhDj] is leveraged against a friend's life when the [Friend or Idol Decision][M0x87kdY] comes along.
- Giving up your ambitions: Usually these are selfish or dark ambitions, and denying them *helps* the character in the long run. When a character wants [Revenge][dvmtUVf5] for the murder of a [loved one][MpqEZL8g] in a world where [If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him][Xg0V0DLV], their giving up murder (though not necessarily forgiving the villain) will cost them dearly but ultimately be the right thing. However, this can extend to less dark goals, when [Ambition Is Evil][s6JXoiA3]. If the story deems the character's dream as "selfish" or bad, they have no choice but to give up.
- Good behaviour. Obvious as it is, being good requires *acting* good. This means sharing, [forgiving others][qEuVY0c9], not killing people and generally acting contrary to one's impulses to be a [Jerkass][7wa7MkDQ] to those disliked. No matter how much they may wish or be tempted to do otherwise.
- Humility and honesty. Honesty is a big source of Suck when being good. It means that any wrong doing on your part (or your friends') must be revealed. Worse, it means denying [Protagonist-Centered Morality][aOKCbo5i] and obeying the law. The character may find that to do what is right means going against stupid laws, becoming a wanted man, separated from loved ones, with their "reputation" ruined.
- Doing the right thing [doesn't always mean it's the nice thing.][ztMhlBow] Often in dilemmas where the character has to choose to either [uphold a moral standard or being kind to others][bWAgnBWy]. Whether it's [doing nasty deeds to save someone's life][YGNGBEYQ], [telling an uncomfortable truth][18PU4GFQ], or [guiding someone harshly in order for them to learn][54IWu3oC], the character will have to go against their kind nature and [do what they have to do][iMPY3dXV] for the sake of doing what's right. [The character will not enjoy this at all][zDpB1tpP]. This may cause other characters to [hate and resent the hero for making tough decisions that he is morally obligated to do.][H6vo70fb]
- [Redemption][pxjLU0pC]: A character realizing that [Being Evil Sucks][ec5eYFzD] will turn to the side of good, only to find out that it comes at a price since [Redemption Equals Affliction][ZKsOnQc8]. This means the character has to put aside their ego and acknowledge that they are in the wrong, accept their karmic punishment, and [work hard to regain the trust and respect from others][xLN8s7lM], even if people [aren't willing to forgive][YrtmCPii] or [at least forget][gOOIMLT3] what they've done.
- Giving up on a [Love Interest][g5UW20mm], [so that they can be truly happy with someone else][a0L4SBa9], or somewhere else, or doing something else. You may end up with [someone else][xEK6iyGA]...or you may end up a [Celibate Hero][kJtVuD5d] or dead.
- Giving up some comfort because someone else has a [Greater Need Than Mine][Y6D1SZHa].
- Saving people, even if they don't deserve it. Whether the person in need of saving is [The Bully][eTmrZlC8], [Alpha Bitch][d1dXqtxz], [a group of characters who hate and mistreat the hero][RU743ugo], or even [the villain][Fj9lD7eb], the hero must suck it up and lend a hand to his enemies and rivals, and [refusing to save them and let them suffer their fate][506UdW5S] is a huge no no. It doesn't matter if they [continue to show him zero respect after being saved][QAB0JdJP], the hero must keep on saving them whether they like it or not.
- Achieving a goal by doing things the honorable way. By honorable, we mean that the character must understand that [Evil Is Easy][Q5ZhLSnP], and he must work at the crack of dawn, avoid taking shortcuts, [avoid the temptation of doing things that would jeopardize their morals as well as the people around them][s6JXoiA3], and [declining any offer of success given to them all in the name of hard work.][0vLLKD4l]

At times, it can lock characters into [Status Quo Is God][iITZpECc], where success requires an evil action, making winning and staying good impossible.

On the other side of the fence, this crops up when [Evil Feels Good][TtFBR8xz]. Often applies to a [Heel–Face Turn][pxjLU0pC] character, or a hero who laments that they have to save somebody they hate from a burning building, or they don't get to kill their most hated enemy, because that's the "heroic" decision.

In a [Crapsack World][YkY7ChsG], this trope applies to a great degree but being *anything* in such a world generally sucks.

[Contrast][SkVwaub4] [Being Evil Sucks][ec5eYFzD]. Also, see [Downer Ending][waeWSybt], or, if you're lucky, [Earn Your Happy Ending][AlRJQJWE]. Compare [No Good Deed Goes Unpunished][BW1IsYBy], where the good action (rather than the process of being good) is what gets the characters in trouble. May result in someone expressing [Sympathy for the Hero][e15IP9ol]. Contrast [Karma Houdini Warranty][jLnlB0Kz], where trying to turn over a new leaf can bring down heaven's wrath. This is one way people become an [Iron Woobie][JydrG4lk] or a [Knight In Sour Armor][YaxH59dw], depending on whether the suffering is taken with quiet dignity or grumpy complaining. This belief is the original mentality of a [Moral Pragmatist][W5DNEIW6] before a [Heel–Face Turn][pxjLU0pC] or someone tries to [Cut Lex Luthor a Check][OES0C47H], but they may wind up here again if they're proven right.

There are many instances in real life in which being 'good' doesn't suck that much. Scientifically, deeds perceived as good - whether or not they are good - entail social recognition and approval, and bad deeds entail reprisal. Most villains or villainous groups might also view their actions as 'good' in some sense, however, and therefore it might be unclear that this counts as 'good' in the same sense as a story with an author-determined moral compass. Justice is one of the fundamental evolutionary imperatives that allows human society to function coherently; we may not all be saints, but we're not all lawless murderers. Unless you're a [Villain with Good Publicity][d5trDc71] It's usually more profitable to abide by society's rules, and even in that case you could be best off being [Affably Evil][PKszKpuQ]. However, the more you could influence perception in such a context, the less it would matter here whether or not you were evil. Of course, multiple societies might have different and often conflicting moral codes, even within their own confines; further, if people like Karl Marx (himself a 'villain' to some, but not all) are to be believed, the conflict within societies can sometimes be such as to give rise to fundamentally opposed forces and force recourse to struggle. Further, moral codes change over time, and this occasionally leads to conflicts between earlier morality and new trends. As a result, a simplistic application of the story-telling categories of 'villains' and 'heroes' from fiction to real life might be worth avoiding, when it comes to this trope.

Always underdogs, they fight using guerrilla warfare and by [raising the rabble](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabbleRouser) of the people by [revealing unpleasant truths](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheResistance) about [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) they've been trying to hide, causing the oppressed peoples to shake off the yokes of their tyrant rulers. Usually led by a [Rebel Leader](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader) and armed via [Vehicular Turnabout](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularTurnabout). Expect them to be opposed by [Les Collaborateurs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs).

Almost inevitably, [The Hero](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero) will join La Resistance while the battle is already underway, and will grow to become a great champion in the fight against [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire). After all, [Hollywood](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory) usually [romanticizes resistance fighters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeVillified), for three reasons. The first is rooted in America's origins as rebels fighting the English during [The American Revolution](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution). The second is likewise [World War II](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII) where the conflict between the Resistance and [Nazi Germany](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany) fell, as close as it ever has, to clear divisions between right and wrong, and of course, [Cool People Rebel Against Authority](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPeopleRebelAgainstAuthority). In most cases in history and in [Real Life](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife), resistance movements are complex and confusing events. A common mistake is to confuse resistance movements with revolutionary movements, when this is not always the case. Some resistance movements *are* revolutionary, seeking to install a new regime to displace the old. Revolutions, needless to say, are complex, murky and at times brutal affairs. It has led in the past to the new regime forming [the new government](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss) which [can be as bad or worse than the old.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution)

Of course, people rarely like having it pointed out that [these groups are terrorists from the perspective of anyone who disagrees with them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters) and [Innocent Bystanders](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander) who may get caught up in the crossfire of said conflicts. This may be deliberately ironic, perhaps inviting a "we are [Not So Different](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent)" moment. Or, [the author might simply assume that the audience will always sympathize with rebel protagonists](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality) against [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire), [therefore moral justification of the rebellion is unnecessary and the rebels can get away with whatever is expedient](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero). This could be averted if the [Evil Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) really is evil and the rebels exercise chivalry and restraint.

Alternatively, La Resistance will be utterly incompetent and little more than an annoyance until the hero gets in there and shows them how it's done. Sometimes [their inner dissensions render them nearly unable to get anything done.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether) Expect at least one member of La Resistance to be [The Mole](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole), or a homegrown [Les Collaborateurs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs) sabotaging their efforts from the inside. La Resistance may even be defeated without the assistance of its enemy: when the only thing uniting it is opposition to [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire), they may end up clashing thanks to some point of ideology (generally portrayed as stupid) or method (generally portrayed as worthwhile).

Also alternatively, La Resistance may represent the [last remnants](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant) of the reactionary or counter-revolutionary cronies of the old regime fighting against the Revolutionary Progressive Forces. Once re-installed, the Resistance "heroes" decide to [Retcon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon) the revolution and institute [purges](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge) for the cause of revenge, and remind people why exactly they were toppled in the first place. In some cases, as it happened in some parts of [World War II](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII), the Resistance contains factions who want to restore the old regime and factions which want to bring a new regime, and these two factions might struggle during and after the war.

When La Resistance form the main ensemble of the show, or one of them, they'll frequently exhibit a mix of characters similar to [The Squad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad). However, they'll usually have [sneakier methods](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpySpeak), they tend to be more morally pragmatic and ruthless than most [Squads](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad), and in series like *[Battlestar Galactica](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003)* members becoming [Shell Shocked Veterans](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran).

Sometimes La Resistance can be [downright nasty](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeCivilized). Usually, though, even at its worst La Resistance will be the [Lesser of Two Evils](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesserOfTwoEvils). If not, [Grey-and-Gray Morality](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality) may be at play. In an interesting twist, if the resistance [is every bit as unscrupulous as](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil) [The Empire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire), then the hero will end up doing a bit of [Conspiracy Redemption](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyRedemption) or [forming a third faction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption). *Very* occasionally, La Resistance may even be the [Big Bad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad) rebelling against a peaceful government. Occasionally, La Resistance will be shown in a more [comedic light, where they don't do much besides sitting around debating theory](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolutionariesWhoDontDoAnything).

Eventually, La Resistance will either die out, or grow into [The Alliance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance) as it gains power, allies, and sympathizers.

For the villainous equivalent, see [The Remnant](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant). For the opposite of La Resistance, see [Les Collaborateurs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs). Sometimes La Resistance may not be heroes but *villains*, as happens in an [Enemy Civil War](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar).

Compare [Vigilante Militia](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMilitia) and [The Magnificent Seven Samurai](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificentSevenSamurai).

Not to be confused with the [First-Person Shooter](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter) series, *[Resistance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance)*. Or with WWE's French-Canadian [Foreign Wrestling Heel](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel) [Tag Team](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam) [La Résistance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LaResistanceWrestling).

### Advanced Ancient Humans

This trope is when modern-day/near-future humans discover that they actually had a super advanced society eons ago, in pre-history. In other words, *Homo sapiens* are their own [Precursors][pt2Rj4Bc]. This prehistoric civilization, for whatever reason, fell or disappeared before our recorded history began, thus explaining why nobody knew about it before. Oftentimes they lived in an [Advanced Ancient Acropolis][pCEvxbEm] which they'll leave behind for present explorers to marvel at.

Compare [Human Aliens][OQfShY9V], [Adam and Eve Plot][1JYuvEYf], [Earth All Along][LrZZsZqF]. For a specific subtrope of this, see [Atlantis][f9CbYB3w] (depending on how advanced it's depicted as being). For *any* species that came before us, including aliens, see [Precursors][pt2Rj4Bc]. Compare [Ultra Terrestrials][nlkpBiZh], when an alien species turns out to also be from Earth but developed and left way in pre-history (before humans were around). Often overlaps with [Humanity Came From Space][jki7VDm6]. When the story is set in a future where humanity is extinct, see [Humanity's Wake][nueGQCNc]. See [Humanity Is Advanced][DbQvPd7d] where humanity is the current Advanced Alien. If we have evolved to the point these guys are not immediately recognizable as human they may also be [Original Man][OsUKMvLV].

            <Title>Concept &amp; Theme</Title>
            <Text>**Strand** is  a [low fantasy], [Type-X] [alternative-history] series written by Ben Wilson.

In the 18th Century, British-Americans uncover an [ancient acropolis] that introduces ([advanced, ancient human]) [lost technology] in the Ohio Territory at the end of the Seven Years' War. This leads to [America remaining in the UK] despite continued struggle by the Sons of Liberty. Britain becomes a [low culture, high tech] society. We have a faction (SOL) who want to divide, and a faction (Tory) who want to unite; both want to control the strange tech, but ultimately come together to keep it from the French &amp; Indians.

Throughout the 19th Century, a secret British society reverse-engineers the [Neutrinovoltaic power][phlebotinum]. This increases degrees of separation between Britain and the rest of the world, creating a [decade dissonance]. A technological espionage struggle ensues among the great powers. The Napoleonic &amp; Crimean wars occur per OTL, but with different outcomes. British North America starts its Western expansion, leading to the Mexican war, which becomes British.

By the 20th Century, technological equilibrium is established with Britain replicating its IRL trade dominance benefiting Europe. The UK re-invents slipstream travel, with Albert Strand ultimately strand on Elysion and trying to get home. Belize becomes the launch region for space travel.

In Strand Series, we explore the perennial struggle of a society when its technological capabilities out-strips its morality. Most Americans do not understand the technology they use. Nor are they interested in its long-term implications. We also explore the tension between centralism/de-centralism, individualism, etc. As religion was a significant part of society, Christianity will be explored in a manner non-threatening to the reader.

We also explain how American remaining a part of Great Britain would not have hindered our global dominance. But, what about the Bill of Rights &amp; Constitution?

### Blood Knight

"...HAVE AT THEE!"

Fighting is everything to the Blood Knight. He *lives* for it. It's not so much about winning or losing, morality, the motives of his allies, or even [the glory][8YZ36INZ], that drives this guy so much as it is the opportunity for a good fight.

A Blood Knight can be of any morality whatsoever, although [Anti Heroes][u0ObArmO] and [Anti Villains][T1JTqSvg] tend to be most common.

Heroic examples will frequently be [The Big Guy][5AO8omI0] in an ensemble, the character most likely to solve his problems by force of arms. They might make the less violent members of the crew a little nervous, especially if they go off on a [hair trigger][Owwr10io]. He may merely enjoy the challenge and not hurting others necessarily; some don't hurt people unprovoked since they have a sense of right and wrong.

The Blood Knight doesn't even have to be a particularly violent man most of the time. A common version found in Eastern fiction is the Wandering Martial Artist, who [Wanders the Earth][6n9nyaLq] looking for strong opponents to test his skills against. This might be coupled with a love of fair duels and a desire to [challenge][7dnaJisw] the [best and strongest][lrtGZFKZ]. This type still enjoys the thrill of the fight, but usually eschews the death and bloodshed aspect. A living opponent, after all, can improve their skills and provide an even better challenge later. [Defeat Means Friendship][NTCSooGt] is a common occurrence with these guys, their opponent's or their own.

As an antagonist, he has a good chance of being an [Anti-Villain][T1JTqSvg], since he doesn't want to kill the heroes, necessarily, just fight them. If he can find someone [tough enough to beat him][NTCSooGt] he might undergo a [Heel–Face Turn][4ddyN6KV] and join the hero's team, or simply gain a [newfound respect][n7LzcJdO] for his foe that he [didn't have before][xSMzlNtw]. He might deliberately disadvantage himself in order to make fights last longer and loves to reveal that [he is not left-handed][w3ZnU22j]. Despite the brutality that this trope implies, it's not uncommon for them to be a [Noble Demon][1iLD0xRO] as well when they want an exciting fight on *specific terms* or when they reject unfair advantages because it would make the fight no fun. He may even betray his boss if he insists on interfering to [pursue and obsess][lBfukRYT] over his [foe][B9FcHDEW] on his own terms. Less pleasant ones may [do all kinds of horrible things][fySftJb4] to provoke their opponents into fighting them. Though if they specifically love to kill (rather than fight) they are a [Psycho for Hire][ffygDGaN].

Personality-wise, more evil ones may be a [Flat Character][I8c8GuS9] (and quite possibly [The Brute][JMPoKDNg]) who just shouts ["Maim! Kill! Burn!"][G4RmY0dD]. Good/[Sympathetic][T1JTqSvg] ones are usually more sophisticated/developed and can have aspects of the [Warrior Therapist][HLHEVKhg], [Warrior Poet][lMZ37H5w] or [Cultured Warrior][VpmxUQ6I]. He might be a [normal, jocular guy][jJapQwqJ] when he's not brawling, or he might take the fight so seriously that [he blocks out everything else][m6t0OFPg] and will therefore live only for battle. In some cases, the Blood Knight fights because he's [looking for a way to die with meaning][nQOjGvHQ].

A [War God][T3JPzWrI] is very often one of these though he could also be [Ax-Crazy][7zRo270J] or just [The Sociopath][yKKrXD8t]. If there's a whole society of guys who like combat, you've got a [Proud Warrior Race][iJeuyt4b]. If the character likes the 'killing' part more than the 'fighting' part, they're a [Psycho for Hire][ffygDGaN]. The [Egomaniac Hunter][EisKT81j] also thrives on aimless violent thrill and loves a worthy quarry instead of an opponent. If a character is in it for the challenge rather than just the fight, then we've got a [Spirited Competitor][lrtGZFKZ]. The Blood Knight's love of combat may be platonic, or it may have [sexual undertones][fCDTWkPw]. It could also overlap with [Ax-Crazy][7zRo270J] if their love of fighting crosses the line into psychopathic violence and mental and emotional instability.

[Sub-Trope][mQM4b4iB] of [In Harm's Way][xtbR5r4W]. [Sister Trope][OYSiT6UH] to [Combat Sadomasochist][bCT1i3MP], [The Real Man][QD2QFNfT], and [Boisterous Bruiser][jJapQwqJ]. Compare [Cavalier Competitor][i6ocNpLN] and, for a more general trope, [Challenge Seeker][7dnaJisw]. Also compare [Sadist][OFUvPqWd], whose favorite part of fighting is the pain and suffering of his opponent. May be from a [Martyrdom Culture][2rTfKSTe] and will nearly always believe that [War Is Glorious][yyS5CV3Y]. If he (or she, though it's much rarer, however; see [Lady of War][KJTy7GmN]) is in the military, then he will almost inevitably be a [Colonel Kilgore][tJ2lki0n]. A [Monster Knight][aXYfXuSP] has a high chance of being one. A more violent example that nonetheless fights on the side of good may (or may not) be a [Sociopathic Hero][OasPdJsM]. It also has [nothing to do with][icrOJad4] a knight who uses [Blood Magic][TsBq59Ah]. Contrast [Shell-Shocked Veteran][Kst7SKRY], who is of the opposite mindset (also contrast [War Is Hell][YlxlrGDi]).

Oh, just in case it wasn't clear, the character doesn't have to be a literal knight for this trope to apply. It is about the attitude, not the rank.

#### Blood Knight / Playing With

**Basic Trope**: Someone who enjoys fighting.

- **Straight**: Bob loves a good fight and picks a profession that allows him to seek out worthy opponents and enjoys proving his skills against them in battle.
- **Exaggerated**:
    - Bob cannot go a week without getting into some kind of fight just to alleviate boredom if nothing else.
    - Bob starts a religion where brutally murdering your enemy is the best way for his salvation. And for the salvation of his enemies. Or Bob uses elements of "sacred sexuality" like in Tantrism, but replaces everything sexual with the joy of killing his enemies.
- **Downplayed**: Bob enjoys fighting against skilled opponents, but doesn't go out of his way to seek them out.
- **Justified**:
    - As a member of a militaristic culture that glorified warfare and prowess of the battlefield, Bob is merely acting according to his culture's expectations of a good warrior.
    - He started out his [rampage as a revenge][rsGAjpSu], but in the end, he ended up obsessed with fighting.
    - He spills the others' blood [to ease his thirst][sjsLrNzh]. And since nutrition is a pleasure on itself...
    - Combat provides a *massive* adrenaline rush. Bob fights to get the ultimate high.
- **Subverted**: Bob enjoys proving his skill on the battlefield until he meets an opponent that grossly outclasses him in terms of skill. He then finds that fighting is less fun when you're getting your ass kicked.
- **Double Subverted**: Bob's beatdown motivates him to train harder so he can defeat his opponent.
- **Parodied**: Everytime Bob hears about a fight, he immediately goes berserk and runs at the place to start yelling "KILLBURNKILL!!!" and swinging the first heavy object he found and picked up left and right.
- **Zig Zagged**: Whether or not Bob is enjoying a fight depends on a variety of factors, sometimes he's having the time of his life, other times he's just as stressed as everyone else.
- **Averted**: Bob may be a warrior, but he doesn't enjoy fighting in the slightest
- **Enforced**:
    - The writer wants to portray the negative aspects of being obsessed with violence.
    - The writer finds "he goes looking for fights" more realistic as a plot device than "[all the fights come to him][4ni2cnVd]".
- **Implied**: Whenever Bob is in open combat, he seems much more relaxed than in everyday situations.
- **Lampshaded**:
    - "It's been like four days since anybody needed me to punch them. [I. Am. So. BORED.][y3xgDG8B]"
    - "Doesn't he have another fun in his life?"
- **Invoked**: Bob was [raised from birth][zZCFcecU] to love fighting and violence so that he could serve as [The Heavy][AAyI6Lth] for the local [Big Bad][fHDZdx4L].
- **Exploited**: Bob is easy to manipulate, because his love of fighting gets in the way of his critical thinking when it comes to things like "Should I be fighting this guy in the first place?"
- **Defied**: Bob isn't hesitant about fighting when it's necessary, but refuses to let it become something he enjoys for its own sake.
- **Discussed**: "If there's anything I've learned, [Enyo][TMDVGMzX], it's that if you show yourself to be strong, you'll have people lining up to fight. Thus, I want everyone to know how strong you are, so I can find a few combat-addicts to help further defend my plans."
- **Conversed**: "People who like fighting are always written as battle-lusty maniacs — as in, literally, they all but cum in battle, and in an X-rated show they go *that* far, too. It's always like that. You'd think writers would give them a bit more nuance nowadays."
- **Deconstructed**:
    - Bob's tendencies to seek out worthy opponents leads to him getting killed.
    - Bob's love of battle leads him to escalate a situation that could have easily been defused peacefully. He is abandoned by his comrades after the destruction his actions indirectly caused.
    - The person he fights for publically begs him to stop fighting.
- **Reconstructed**:
    - Bob knows his aggressive tendencies put him at risk of doing something stupid, so he emphasizes self-control and learns to enjoy his moments of delayed gratification.
    - Bob is a [Martial Pacifist][6eS4ebwl] who deeply enjoys fighting, but also knows that there is a time and place for it.
    - In the end, Bob loses everything, he gets ostracised by everyone he wanted to defend, gets betrayed and outright killed. Hundred years later, even his enemies consider him a hero because he fought for what he believed, no matter the cost, and risked everything for his values.
- **Played For Laughs**: Bob treats fighting like any other form of entertainment. When everyone goes to the cinema, he goes to the boxing club, and going to war is his idea of a perfect vacation.
- **Played For Drama**:
    - Bob can seldom find any enjoyment in anything other than combat. Despite having been injured multiple times and being ridden by guilt over the times he had to kill someone, he continues to do the only thing that, in his opinion, makes his life worth living.
    - Bob is a [Death Seeker][nIZKOig7] [who can't commit suicide][QKuWKe0c] because it would be [dishonorable][jPFZD177]. Therefore he tries to find [someone who can kill him in a fight][Ua9xr2he].
- **Played For Horror**: Bob is shown laughing with joy, while his fallen enemies scream in pain at his feet.

            <Title>1783-1815: French Troubles</Title>
            <Text>&gt; IRL: At the end of the Seven Years' War, England's strategy in the Treaty of Paris (1763) sought to deter France from start a fifth war. France, however, sought to use the treaty to give them time to rebuild and rearm. French diplomats believed that without France to keep the Americans in check, the colonists might attempt to revolt. The American Revolution was that much-desired revolt.[^paris-treaty-1763]
[^paris-treaty-1763]: Wikipedia. _Treaty of Paris (1763)_.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)

The negotiations between British North America and England and discovery of Toltec Technology blunted the American desire to revolt.

* 1783-1815 - French economy collapses due to Seven Year's War debt and speculation and takes the government with it. The French Revolution is a decade early, ends the same but with American participation in Europe.
* 1802-1815 - War between France and most of Europe. Ended by British &amp; American deployment of Toltec weaponry

The French economy struggles under reparations required in the Treaty of Paris (1763). The government gets caught up in various schemes to pay the debt that results in a popular uprising in 1783.

Napoleon is involved as a republican during the early stages of the struggle, and gains power as expected. England takes control of New Orleans when Napoleon moves on Spain, and keeps it. Napoleon sends troops in 1801, triggering the war between England and France &amp; Spain (the latter as a vassal to France).

This "Napoleonic War" is ended by British &amp; American deployment of Toltec weaponry in 1815. Napoleon is executed and a new French king is placed on the throne. This ends the French Troubles.

The Louisiana Territory is kept by England as compensation for the war, and to further safeguard English interest and control over Toltec artifacts.

            <Text>#### Space Travel

This section discusses the application of slower-than-light (STL) space travel. As IRL, **Strand** space travel involves use of reaction drives, though Toltec technology accelerated the development of very efficient drives.

##### Edison Drives

&lt;!-- * S-250 Series Epstein Drive: A UN drive used on Leonidas-class battleships. This drive is older and less efficient than most current drive models.
* S-400 Series Epstein Drive: A UN drive used on Truman-class dreadnoughts.
* Bush shipyards Black Ops supercooled Epstein drive - CODENAME Silversmith: A drive built on Luna and secretly used on the Amun-Ra-class stealth frigates owned by Protogen.
* RT-10 'Kaminari' Epstein Drive: MCR drive used on Donnager-class battleships.
* RTF-B Series Epstein Drive: MCR drive used on Scirocco-class Assault cruisers.
* RT6-B Epstein Drive: MCR drive used on Morrigan-class Patrol destroyers.
* G-4000 Series Epstein Drive: A very large drive used on the Nauvoo/Behemoth. --&gt;

##### Spacecraft

&lt;!-- Do not break the reaction-based system to keep him on the planet. --&gt;

**Design.** Spacecraft are symmetrically built around a frame. Propulsion is reaction-based, so a considerable amount of the ship's total mass is its consumable reaction material. Ships cannot travel in atmosphere as gravity will crush the frame. Travel between planet and orbitals is done through interface vehicles. **Ships are built like office towers** (Pringles cans), with small decks stacked on top of each other, which experience gravity only when the ship is under thrust.

**Travel.** When traveling, ships accelerate to the midpoint of their journey, turn around, and decelerate. No dogfights, no Immelmann or Crazy Ivan maneuvers. Safe travel means accelerating to a midpoint at 1.0-1.5 G, turn around, decelerate at 1.0-1.5 G, over a period of several days.

**Maneuvering.** Maneuver drives use liquid nitrogen or water heated to boiling point.

**Heat.** Heat is always a problem. An inability to dissipate heat can get one into trouble. Burn your engines too much, or fire too many lasers, and you start to have problems in combat yourself, because of an inability to radiate heat into the darkness of space.

**Payload.** These concerns combine to suggest that a ships payload section is relatively small (10-30% of the ship’s mass), Given the limits on payload, space for crew, weapons, cargo, and extras is limited. Slipdrives are small to allow FTL travel within the design constraints (i.e. we wanted ships both with slipdrives and with guns), and so the limit on FTL travel comes from the point of departure, well above the ecliptic of the system.

### Five-Man Band

Pictured: Everybody in the band.

The Five-Man Band is a group of characters whose members fall into archetypes which all complement one another. They are a very specific team with skills that contribute to the group in a way oddly analogous to the members of a rock band. It can sometimes literally be a musical group, but much more often is not.

The group traditionally includes:

- [The Leader][msRYnP7v] — *(lead singer)* The leader of the group. Can be a mastermind, charismatic, levelheaded, headstrong, or some combination of the four. Often also [The Hero][xEGOLr2Z].
- [The Lancer][bB6fIcqX] — *(lead guitar)* Usually a [contrast][Ld41ALqA] to The Leader. If the Leader is clean-cut and/or uptight, the Lancer is a grizzled [Anti-Hero][vi78sP08] or [Deadpan Snarker][YDBUsnHc]; if the Leader is driven and [somewhat amoral][vi78sP08], the Lancer is more relaxed and level-headed.
- [The Smart Guy][pgA5PZhq] — *(keyboardist)* The physically weak, but intelligent or clever member. Often nerdy and awkwardly played for comic relief. Sometimes unconventionally young (early- to mid-teens). Sometimes [The Trickster][vHGcwCml] and a buddy of the Big Guy.
- [The Big Guy][sYP1KxeK] — *(drummer)* The strongman of the team. May be dumb. Or mute.
- [The Chick][lm204qrW] — *(vocal effects, tambourine)* A peacekeeping role to balance out the other members' aggression, bringing them to a nice or at least manageable medium. The Chick is often considered [the heart][nrzSY30u] of the group. This role is played by a woman or girl. Someone female. Otherwise, it is not a Five-Man Band.

The five-man rock band phenomenon, four guys and a girl singer, is no longer as current as it once was. It was very hard to escape in the 60's and 70's. However, the group structure, as you will see in the examples, turns up in *a lot* of storytelling. Like a *whole* lot of storytelling.

See also [¡Three Amigos!][2U3D4aVg], [Power Trio][Ox3KlVqO], and [Cast Calculus][Ftq2THNh]. Fighting ability is usually determined by [Fixed Relative Strength][3RstFD4S]. Compare the [Command Roster][CuChoTZ3], for military-esque teams. [The Psycho Rangers][lu9PxRdA] are the collective [Evil Counterpart][1grFNlkm] of a given Five-Man Band. See also [Four-Temperament Ensemble][yqLCXrzE].

These are examples of teams that fit **all five** of the character tropes. Remember that they form a team dynamic; it's always tempting to match two of the characters in a show, then try to convince yourself and others that the other characters can be squeezed/wedged/stuffed into the description of the other character types, but that's not the point of the Five-Man Band trope. The individual character types exist outside of the band. **The Five-Man Band only occurs when the team as a whole fits, not just a few characters.**

As a rule of thumb, if your band example has to justify more than two types, or a single trope with more than two sentences of qualifiers, you're trying to fool yourself. If it isn't a Five-Man Band, it isn't a Five-Man Band.

            <Text>#### Charlotina (Ohio)

Following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Charlotina was established as a Crown colony encompassing the OTL US Northwest Territory boundaries. The argument and name emerged in a 1764 Scottish pamphlet entitled _The Expediency of Securing our American Colonies by Settling the Country Adjoining the River Mississippi, and the Country upon the Ohio, Considered_.[^wiki-charlotina] Calving Charlotina from existing colonies provided the Crown with a way of managing Indian relations and generating revenue. While land in Charlotina was given to Seven Year's War veterans as OTL, the Crown sought a more active role in assigning the land. Washington managed to make himself the Royal Surveyor, which allowed him to exploit land grants as he sought to do OTL. Washington instituted the Township survey method instead of the traditional metes &amp; bounds method. The Temple is in Charlotina, making its history relevant.

[^wiki-charlotina]: Wikipedia. _Charlotina_. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotina.

**Boundaries.**
Charlotina included the region lying west of the Maumee and Wabash rivers; north of the Ohio River; east of the upper Mississippi River; and south of the Great Lakes. These boundaries would include portions of modern-day Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and the entirety of Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Charlotina will later include the modern-day cities of Chicago, Milwaukee, Toledo, Detroit, Fort Wayne, and parts of Minneapolis and St. Paul.
The Charlotina-Pennsylvanian border starts from the Easternmost end of Lake Erie, heading down a True South line until that line intersects the Allegheny River (near OTL intersection of I-86 and Rt-280/Quaker Run Road). It then follows the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh.
The Charlotina-Mississippian border starts at the intersection of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at Pittsburgh and continues along the Ohio where Charlotina is on the northern bank and Mississippi is on the southern bank.
The Charlotina-Canadian border follows the middle point of the Great Lakes...

### SchizoTech

The setting and timeline may seem at first to be [The Middle Ages](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges), [The Colonial Period](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheThirteenAmericanColonies), or some [Fantasy Counterpart Culture](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture) thereof, but when you look closer, you find polyester, robots, or other high-tech toys in between the horse-drawn wagons and wattle-and-daub buildings. There's generally no rhyme or reason for *which* technologies are anachronistically present besides the [Rule of Cool](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool). Sometimes these may be leftovers from a [lost technological civilization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology), or perhaps it could be that science developed along a different path than ours, allowing for more advanced technology in one field, while stagnating in others, but most of the time there is no explanation whatsoever for the bizarre mix of medieval and futuristic.

Schizo Tech is a key component of [Punk Punk](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkPunk). It's also the foundation for [Fantasy Gun Control](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl). Compare [Decade Dissonance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadeDissonance) for when one side has all the cool toys. When a story nominally set in a real-life historical period has this problem, you've got yourself some tasty [Anachronism Stew](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew). It may be because an [isolated branch of mankind](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies) created an [Advanced Ancient Acropolis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientAcropolis). [After the End](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd) is normally a good justification of this; often resulting in [Scavenger World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld), especially when you have a faction with [Low Culture, High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech).

When evaluating a candidate for this trope, try not to confuse anachronisms with non-western-isms. For example, a kimono can be just as modern as a three-piece suit, if not more so. Likewise, do not confuse anachronism for cosmetic purposes with anachronism of technological capability. For example, though you will see lots of [Zeppelins from Another World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld) at work in Schizo Tech, [Airships](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Airships) themselves are not more or less advanced than airplanes or helicopters, just suited to different situations—namely, ones that value endurance, payload and fuel efficiency over speed and maneuverability. Alternatively, a judge wearing an eighteenth century robe and wig while judging cybercrime cases is not schizo tech, but simply a remnant of the [Good Old Ways](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays). And again, [Tropes Are Still Not Bad](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools). It's also worth noting that in the alternate history of a candidate, the culture and style may simply be different, so while their older architecture may seem to jar with their higher levels of technology, it may be that that style of architecture is just "in" at that time. In dealing with other cultures, also remember that the concept of [Technology Levels](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels) is flawed, and that [real societies are not obliged to all invent the same things in the same order, and may miss some inventions entirely.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel)

Most comic book universes have this trope as a natural consequence: the wondrous science held by the [heroes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRIchardsIsUseless) and [villains](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck) would, if even partially distributed, violate the surprisingly mundane world that divides the superhero genre from outright [Speculative Fiction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction). Examples and subversions are noted below.

This trope has frequently been [Truth in Television](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision) depending on the circumstances, with historical works involving [World War I](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI) and other major events that were technological 'kitchen sink' like affairs (with cavalry charges co-existing with airplane bombing runs) one hundred percent qualifying. Beware: Many sci-fi settings that aren't [harder than diamond](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfSciFiHardness) can become this *constantly* if you think about it too hard.

Compare [Adventure-Friendly World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureFriendlyWorld), [Anachronism Stew](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew), [Culture Chop Suey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey), and [Fantasy Kitchen Sink](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink). [Technology Levels](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels) is what this trope averts. As well as [Medieval European Fantasy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy), of course. If the old stuff proves as effective as the new stuff, you've also got an [Archaic Weapon for an Advanced Age](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchaicWeaponForAnAdvancedAge). It may also be the byproduct of a [Retro Universe](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroUniverse). Contrast [Days of Future Past](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast). [Not to be confused with](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant) tech used by schizophrenics.

* Material Toughness. Measured by the energy required to break a continuous filament, expressed in joules per kilogram (J/kg). A .357 caliber bullet has approximately 925 joules of kinetic energy at impact. A .308 caliber bullet has approximately 2,700 joules of kinetic energy at impact.
* Tensile Strength. Tensile strength refers to the greatest longitudinal stress the spider silk can bear, measured by force over area in units of newtons per square meter. The measurement here is in millions of pascals.
* Weight. In grams per cubic centimeter of material.

Toughness v. Other Weapons. Comparing Kevlar / Dragon Silk against 18th Century Weapons, namely Arrows and .80 caliber lead shot.

* Brown Bess musket has about 3,800 joules of kinetic energy. A Civil War v. Kevlar video shows the bullet will not penetrate, but blunt force trauma may be a concern. 

* An Arrows &amp; Body armor video shows that a 70# pull bow will pierce NIJ IIIa soft protection (with either field or broadhead arrow), but not NIJ III hard protection, without blunt force trauma as the arrow lacks sufficient kinetic energy.
Behind Armor Blunt Trauma (BABT)

BABT is the non-penetrating injury resulting from the rapid deformation of armors covering the body. Called mushrooming. Injuries will be rib fracture, hematoma in the lung, heart.

* 50% of pigs died with 40mm, vice 25% at 34mm, 0% at 28mm.
* takes about 5 minutes to recover after being shot...low blood pressure and low O2 levels
* Beneath the body armor point of impact, an almost circular skin lesion consisting of cutaneous abrasions with subcutaneous hematomas were evident in all exposed animals. A rib fracture was found beneath the skin lesion in some animals, but no hemothorax or pneumothorax was observed. All exposed animals exhibited a hematoma in the right lung underlying the impact area; some showed smaller areas of emphysema.

* Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, 26% of cases.
* Cardiac contusion, 54% of cases, 29% ruptures.
* 8 layers of Kevlar sufficient to dissipate 82% of kinetic energy. 

* Premier's III hard protection is 10x12" weighing 2.5# per plate. Call it 7# for the vest. 
* Premier's IIIa soft vest is .22" of Kevlar. Dragon silk is 3.5x stronger, so 0.06" thick is equivalent.  A flannel shirt is 0.015". Therefore a comparable dragon silk vest is 4 times thicker than a flannel shirt, or more like a heavy denim jacket.

            <Text>##### Government of British America

In 1754, Benjamin Franklin proposed what became known as the Albany Plan[^albany-plan]. This plan proposed a Grand Council which essentially gave British North America home rule. While the plan was rejected, it was the basis of the negotiated reconciliation between British North America and Britain. These privileges were not extended to the British West Indies, leading to some friction with the Indies that was mitigated by the Indies planters establishing residences in Carolina.[^OTL-Albany Plan]

[^OTL-Albany Plan]: OTL: Benjamin Franklin proposed the plan at the Albany Congress at the age of 46. The plan was rejected both by the colonies and Parliament. Elements of this Plan recurred during the Continental Congress.

The **Council of British North America** represented the split interests of the former colonies, Crown and Parliament. It was bicameral, with the House of Representatives comprising provincial delegates appointed by the provincial assemblies. As with the Albany Plan, each province was given between two and seven seats based upon the _proportional amount of revenue_ they provided to the Commonwealth. House of Ministers represented a smaller body of ministers appointed by Parliament to consult on legislation from the House of Representatives, with one minister appointed per province. The Council (also known as the Grand Council) managed local affairs between the provinces and local Indian tribes. Parliament retained right of refusal provided they acted within three years of the legislation.

Internal provincial legislation is managed via **Provincial Assemblies**. Each Assembly was bicameral, with the House of Lords appointing the Council of State and province landowners electing members of the Council of Commons. The Crown appoints a Lieutenant Governor as executive to each Province, as well as the Governor of British America. Each provincial government appoints 9 seats to the British Parliament, for a total of 54 seats in the Commons. Compare this with the 45 seats given to Scotland in 1707.

The result of this governmental structure is that the legislatures are dominated by local oligarchies. These oligarchs jealously defend their power, thus quieting the American Troubles, and largely followed the Lords' suggestions.

The British America Act of 1771 restructured British America (the continent) into six provinces: Canada, New England, Pennsylvania (includes IRL New York), Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia. This led to six Provincial Assemblies. This led to a significant amount of internal tension within all but Georgia.

            <Title>Mook dies in Burnt Cabin / Sidneyville</Title>
            <Text>
**November 20, N.S 1763.**

&lt;!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannett_Township,_Franklin_County,_Pennsylvania --&gt;
&lt;!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnt_Cabins,_Pennsylvania --&gt;

Lance Corporal Miller rode uneasily toward Fannett. He was a foot soldier, unaccustomed to riding a horse. They had been riding since they left New Haven, so he was getting better at it. He would rather be walking. He cursed Ephraim Biggs for pulling him further away from civilization.

The town of Fannett was a ride up a narrow path through the mountains from Shippensburg. Miller knew well the area may have savages. The French may have withdrawn to focus on other parts of the world, but the savages were native to the land. They would not leave. The presence of several English settlements did nothing to alleviate his professional concern. He rode carefully, watchful for any sign of threat. The journey took all day.

He arrived in Fannett as the sun had just set. Its reputation as a town was a far cry from what it was. Four cabins flanked the trail. There would be no Ephraim Biggs here. The officers ordered him ask, so he would ask.

He dismounted and went to the more substantial of the cabins. None of them looked inviting. He pounded on the door, wishing he had his musket instead of a pistol and hatchet.

The door opened up slightly. The barrel of a musket poking through. "What do you want?" The accent was Irish.

"Sir, I am looking for Ephraim Biggs. He's a preacher, or smith, or something." He hesitated. "Um, he's a friend of mine."

"You're the only stranger in these parts."

"Alright. No need to be alarmed. As I said, he's a friend. He said he was coming this way."

A harumph came from the other side of the door. "Your friend must have sent you the wrong way, Englishman."

"Alright. I believe you." He took a moment to assess the situation. He needed shelter through the night so he could press on the next day. "Is there somewhere for my horse and I to stay?"

"Not here. Be off with you."

The door slammed as the musket barrel was withdrawn. Miller breathed a sigh of relief. He tried the other cabins to see if any would accept him for the night. With each refusal, he grew more frustrated. _If they knew I was a part of the regiment sent to protect them._ He wanted to exercise what authority being a member of the Royal American Regiment conveyed, but suspected by their Irish accents the effort would meet with more than the hostility he had just experienced.

He considered his options, and remembered the clearing. He saw it right at dusk, a few furlongs back. He led the horse back to the clearing, and settled down for the night. Sleeping in the open was not novel to him, though in those times he was accompanied by several hundred men and muskets with pickets and cannon. He counted himself lucky when his unit was reassigned to New Haven. It was as far from any of their campaigns as he could have expected. He cursed this detail to hunt a fugitive as he fell asleep. He did not understand why a simple murder would result in such a manhunt. They happen with regularity in England.

He woke the next day sore and cold. His horse was content grazing on some nearby grass. Miller made a small fire for warmth. He ate a bit of breakfast. "If I wait another day or two and head back, they will be none the wiser," he said to the horse. "It's not like you would report me. You like this place well enough. None of these people would report to Captain Bethlehem either." It was just the sort of thing he sorely wanted to do. He suspected that bastard would ask him some silly question like a description of the settlements. "Bethlehem has that glare that read right through you."

He finished breakfast and extinguished the fire. He resaddled the horse and resumed his journey down the path. It was another climb through a mountain down a narrow path. At the bottom of the mountain he crossed a creek. A few minutes later, he stopped. There were several burnt cabins along the path. The path itself was used, but there was no sign of habitation. He looked up at the sun and judged it was barely noon.

"Well, this is the second town. If a many like Biggs came this way, I'd be surprised." He patted his horse. "I know where you can get your supper. Let's go back to Fannett." He turned the horse around.

As they reached the creek, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. He recoiled from the suddenness of it and accidentally pulled on the tether. The horse reared back, dumping him onto the trail.

Miller looked at the source of pain and saw an arrow lodged in his lower right chest, just above where the ribcage starts. He unconsciously screamed. He simultaneously wanted to pull it out or run. While he hesitated, another arrow slammed into his chest, closer to the heart. He tried to run, but his legs lost their ability to move. A third arrow went through the breastbone and into his heart. His legs went out from under him.

He tried to get up, but none of his muscles responded. He wanted to run away, but could not. He rested his head on the path, smelling the earthiness of it. He was tired. The ride made him want to take a nap.

As he faded to semi-consciousness, he felt his head being grabbed and jerked. He could not see the face, but the hair was long. He imagined it was a beautiful woman cradling his head. She combed his hair with a very sharp comb. He fell asleep.</Text>

### Hobbes Was Right

*"The people, they know where I stand. They need rules to live by—I provide them. They break the rules, I break them. That's the way it works. Rights? Sure, I'm all for rights. But not at the expense of order."*

The only forces capable of controlling this setting are tyrants, dictators and authoritarian groups. Any attempt at democracy is [a doomed enterprise][WkgIb0zN], formulated by [Wide-Eyed Idealists][mbB4J6Zp] working under the belief that there is a grain of selflessness in *any* person.

That this be a *benevolent* dictatorship [is optional][b72W3BPq] (in fact, the presence of a benevolent dictator would suggest Hobbes was *wrong*).

Named after Thomas Hobbes, who wrote in the 17th-century book *Leviathan* that strong, centralized government is necessary to protect mankind from its own base nature and self-serving desires. The trope is based on a [Flanderized][7vm4GDUp] version of his philosophy. It is worth noting that many medieval kings (as an isolated example) had to be strong and bastardly to be effective. Naturally, this opinion goes hand in hand with the belief that [Humans Are Bastards][XGPRcAol], possibly [Humans Are Morons][WEnLJFHb] if the arguments are about the reliability of human judgment if power is left in the hands of the many (though when one considers who the only available candidates for rulership are—[namely, members of that same species of bastard morons][ZwyQ8TdA]…). Indeed, Rousseau—the chief defender of the contrary position—had some choice words for Hobbes (although Hobbes, being dead, couldn't appreciate the insults).

Contrast [Machiavelli Was Wrong][1JA9zHEq] and [Rousseau Was Right][3xLrhf80]; compare and contrast [The Extremist Was Right][PsuWvKwS], [The Evils of Free Will][UQJYyCIq], [Realpolitik][1QRPRXjd] and [Utopia Justifies the Means][HZr1rBiR]. Has nothing to do with *[Calvin and Hobbes][7o7VAa2T]*, though *that* Hobbes was named after this one. For Hobbes' views on the supernatural, see [Devil, but No God][TbBuDFLf] and [Burn the Witch!][63lbJCV0]

            <Title>Ephraim Thrives in Chambersburg</Title>
            <Text>
November 21, N.S 1763. Ephraim wiped his brow. The long day's work had taken its toll. Not as much as it had the first few weeks, but enough to assure him he would sleep well tonight. He grinded from apprentice into journeyman at his father's smithy from the age of seven to seventeen. He knew his way around the shop. Had he kept at it, he would have become a master by 21.

It was grueling work, and his father wanted him to follow Jeffry's lead and become an attorney. This despite Jeffry's insistence that he study in Philadelphia, hoping to enter into Dr. Franklin's society.

The last think Ephraim wanted was apprentice to an attorney. He refused. For years his father continued the pressure for Ephraim to not become a smith. All the while, he toiled at the forge. Years of persistance paid off. Ephraim agreed to enter the ministry. It took a few years to prepare, but by seventeen he was admitted to Yale College. Over the past three years, he filled his mind with divinity, and his muscles weakened.

O'brien daily reminded Ephraim why he should have stayed at Yale. Not that he could under the circumstances. He would not be welcome in Connecticut ever again. He put that out of his mind and finished cleaning the shop. The sun was nearly set and he had not finished. It had been this way for weeks. He only got rest on Sundays, and spent most of his time then asleep. O'brien was getting the most out of the bargain that he could. Ephraim's income was limited to sleeping in the loft and foot from O'brien's table.

Taking a short break Ephraim looked out to the road that led back to Shippensburg. He saw a man walking, followed by a beautiful black horse on its tether. The horse limped on its front left leg. Ephraim sighed. It would be nightfall before he finished.

He walked toward the man, shortening the distance. "Your horse. Bit of a limp?" His voice strained to speak though a dry mouth.

"I rode him across a stream a couple miles back. He slipped, and he's been limping since." The man was curt, his accent clearly English.

Ephraim took the lead and led the horse toward the shop's lamp. Inspecting, he saw a piece of stone caught in the hoof. He patted the horse gently as he set the leg back. He picked a pair of pliers off the workbench. He returned to the horse and lifted the leg. The horse started to shuffle. "He's worried. Calm him?"

The stranger moved up to the horse's head and stroked him. The horse settled. Ephraim grabbed the stone with the pliers and gently pulled. The stone was wedged in worse than it looked. He shifted and braced the leg more firmly and tried with more muscle. After a couple minutes, the stone came out.

Ephraim looked at the stone. It was flat and narrow, the sort of shale that everything seemed to be made out of. He held it up to the rider. "Pretty big piece. He's a tough one to walk as far as he did." He dropped the stone and inspected the hoof. There was only slight damage.

"Whoever shoed your horse did a fine job. If you can manage to stay off of him for a few days, he should be fine. If you have to ride him, take it easy. Maybe wade across with him if you have to cross another stream?"

The rider pursed his lips. "Sure. How much?"

Ephraim shook his head. "No charge."

"Is there somewhere I can rest?"

"There's an old tavern a bit that way. Most people seem to pass here from Shippensburg and go to Getty's ford and stay there."

"How far is that?"

Ephraim shrugged. He turned to O'brien. "How far to Getty's?"

"Getty's? Why? That's over the mountain."

"Isn't that where people go from Shippensburg?"

"No. Elizabethtown, down in Maryland. That's about another day's ride straight down the road."

"Aren't we in Maryland now?" the rider said.

"Depends on who's asking. The Penns say we're in Pennsylvania. The Calverts say Maryland. Colonel Chambers would prefer we were in Pennsylvania since he holds a land grant from them. That's his." O'brien pointed at the fort.

The rider studied O'brien and Ephraim. "It sounds like your Irish, old man. And you're American."

"Yes. From Philadelphia. Any reason?"

The rider shook his head. His voice derisive. "I could not imagine anyone working for the Irish. This continent perpetually amazes me."

O'brien closed on the rider. "You'd better be off to the tavern now."

Judging from the look of the rider, Ephraim knew if it came to blows between the Irish and English, O'brien would triumph. The scene faintly reminded him of New Haven.

The rider hesitated. "Forgive my manners. No offense intended. It has been a long day."

Ephraim nodded.

The rider touched his hat the way Ephraim had seen redcoats. The rider took the horse's lead and made for the tavern.

"Damned English. No matter where they go, they think they're the master."

"They are of us, for now."

"Aye. I've heard that before. Here is farther from England than Cork, but not far enough."

Ephraim chuckled, agreeing with the sentiment. "We'll have to see what happens when this war ends."

"If the last two are any indication, we'll be in another one by 1780. They seem to happen with every new king. You're young enough to see that one. I won't. It would be great to be rid of the English, but I have no fondness for the French, Spanish or Indian." O'brien sighed. His age showed more than Ephraim had noticed before. "At least there are a bunch of Germans around us. They seem content to be left alone. And the quakers are only trouble for them, not for me." He clapped Ephraim on the shoulder. "Jeffry lad, you've done a fine job. You know your way around a shop nearly as well as I."

"Thank you."

"But you know there's not a lot of work for the both of us."

"Telling me to move on?"

"Not yet. Weather's getting dank. I'll let you stay on through the season."

"You can stay in the loft, and I'll pay you what I can. That should give you enough to press on into Virginia come."</Text>

### Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness

[Speculative Fiction][mwMx33wj] fanatics are always raving about how "hard" the science is in various stories — but it's not like you can rub *a story* with a piece of quartz and see if it leaves a scratch on *the plot*. So what is "hardness" in SF? Why do some people want it? And [how do we put a number to it][NOkAqidf]?

Beginning with the first question: "Hard" [Science Fiction][sgdWS6mo] is firmly grounded in reality, with only a few fantastic flights of fancy not justified by science, or with the technology being nonexistent in today's world but probably scientifically possible at some point. "Soft" [Sci-Fi][LXajJBEF] is more flexible on the rules. Even the fantastical aspects of the story will show a divide — in hard SF, they operate through strict, preferably physical, laws, where in soft SF they work in whatever way suits the story best. What this leads to for hard SF is a raised bar for the amount of scientific research the writer must put into the story, and usually [this is shown quite clearly][8HrNu5Wn].

Example: a character is shown a time machine and asks, "How does it work?"

- **In soft SF:** "You sit in this seat, set the date you want, and pull that lever."
- **In hard SF:** "A good question with an interesting answer. [Please have a seat while I bring you up to speed][8iQ04sci] on the latest ideas in quantum theory, after which I will spend a chapter detailing an elaborate, yet plausible-sounding connection between quantum states, the unified field theory, and the means by which the brain stores memory, all tied into theories from both [Albert Einstein][3qaD956S] [and][dfsz3JLW] [Stephen Hawking][LDQ3wJFW]."
- **In really hard SF:** "It doesn't. Time travel to the past is impossible."

Unfortunately for analytical purposes, this pattern is not universal - hard SF stories can skip over the details as long as the basic explanation is correct [given what's been established so far][j1PwGhT3]. Therefore, regardless of the [typical stylistic flourishes][Ucn7wU8t] ("If all stories were written like science fiction stories" by Mark Rosenfelder, a [conlanger][JF4OIW6e]) of hard SF, the only way to define it is self-consistency and scientific accuracy.

Which leads us to the Scale.

#### 1. [Science in Genre Only][IWwAmgHC]

The work is unambiguously set in the *literary genre* of [Science Fiction][sgdWS6mo], but *scientific* it is not. [Applied Phlebotinum][Tr5Te8RN] is the rule of the day, often of the [Nonsensoleum][xTPfjVyz] kind, [Green Rocks][MHJRQ0qR] gain [New Powers as the Plot Demands][pmKfr4nv], and both [Bellisario's Maxim][0Zf3RquH] and the [MST3K Mantra][PuIc3GLg] apply. Works like *[Futurama][0ABzsOm6]*, *[Star Wars][gMEIAaq9]*, *[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann][G7CIHgW1]*, The [DC][jIFoUr2L] and [Marvel][Ug9gAKAB] universes, and *[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy][fIoWDzmF]* fall in this class.

#### 2. [World of Phlebotinum][ZitMy4xA]

The universe is full of [Applied Phlebotinum][Tr5Te8RN] with more to be found behind every star, but the Phlebotinum is dealt with in a [fairly consistent fashion despite its lack of correspondence with reality][j1PwGhT3] and, in-world, is considered to lie within the realm of scientific inquiry. Works like [E. E. “Doc” Smith][4bS5N9zc]'s *[Lensman][Ye3kacUV]* series, *[Neon Genesis Evangelion][uNkklZWO]*, *[Star Trek: The Original Series][cQ3sVlht]*, and *[StarCraft][BQi0XVUl]* fall in this category. A subclass of this class (arguably 2.5 on the scale) contains stories that are generally sound, except the physics aren't our own. Plot aside, they are often a philosophical exploration of a concept [no longer considered true][FxcUSmAI] (such as [Aristotelian physics][IXqHfdLt]), or never considered true in the first place (e.g. two spatial dimensions instead of three, like *[Flatland][QA9xuupk]*). Some of [Arthur C. Clarke][LuigRHmY]'s stories fall here. However, given [the overlap with fantasy][yV3kzfoj], it can [prove tricky][2u7p0y5r] to even classify a story as SF.

#### 3. [Physics Plus][xhoAtoth]

Stories in this class once again have multiple forms of [Applied Phlebotinum][Tr5Te8RN], but in contrast to the prior class, the author aims to justify these creations with [real][8HrNu5Wn] and [invented][T1W79pRq] natural laws — and these creations and others from the same laws will [turn up again and again in new contexts][sfG5JATf]. Works like *[Schlock Mercenary][tLhDCzX3]*, [David Weber][26IsXwtN]'s *[Honor Harrington][0acypL0W]* series, David Brin's *[Uplift][tckHMq15]* series, and *[Battlestar Galactica (2003)][33D2GErh]* fall in this class. Most [Real Robot][lSpdYpyW] shows fall somewhere between Classes 2 and 3.

#### 4. [One Big Lie][11K1XHYU]

Authors of works in this class invent one (or, at most, a very few) counterfactual physical laws and writes a story that explores the implications of these principles. James Blish's *[Cities in Flight][kORNsz1m]* stories fall squarely into this category, courtesy of the "Dirac Equations" leading to the "spindizzy motor" and instantaneous communication. Most works in [Alan Dean Foster][ZPlP4YWe]'s *[Humanx Commonwealth][zgYlUwag]* series, the Ad Astra board games and [Robert A. Heinlein][cRNC2Ulg]'s *[Farnham's Freehold][mQxkQBuo]* fall in this category, as do many of [Vernor Vinge][Z5at8M5n]'s books. This class also includes a subclass (4.5 on the scale) we call *One Small Fib*, containing stories that include only a single counterfactual device (often [FTL Travel][RY9uZfJ6]), but for which the device is not a major element of the plot. Many [Hal Clement][zZhSFO0c] novels (e.g. *[Mission of Gravity][f3I5yyS7]*, *Close to Critical*) and *[Freefall][yYcu3X3p]* fall within the subclass.

#### 5. [Speculative Science][RyMR1kcA]

Stories in which there is no "big lie" — the science of the tale is (or [was][FxcUSmAI]) genuine speculative science or engineering, and the goal of the author to make as few errors with respect to known fact as possible. The first two books in [Robert L. Forward][Z8Pbpsnw]'s *Rocheworld* series and [Robert A. Heinlein][cRNC2Ulg]'s *[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress][wJFvPxb6]* fall in this class. A subclass of this (5.5 on the scale) is *Futurology:* stories which function almost like a prediction of the future, extrapolating from current technology rather than inventing major new technologies or discoveries. (Naturally, [Zeerust][7FovX6em] is common in older entries.) *[Gattaca][FyEVsPqa]*, *[Planetes][I8jG2OnX]*, *[Transhuman Space][v2Qt2MMA]* and the more [Speculative Fiction][mwMx33wj] works of [Jules Verne][hMEAMp1L] fall in this subclass.

#### 6. [Real Life][6gaGmntY] (aka Fiction in Genre Only)

A [Shared Universe][23KUZ3Pv] which spawned its own genre, known as "[Non-Fiction][FrHPeAI5]". Despite the various problems noted at [Reality Is Unrealistic][KHrsZjF1], it is almost universally agreed that there is no other universe known so thoroughly worked out from established scientific principles. [The Apollo Program][R8dvY1Hk], [World War II][wKkRPoT0], [and][so6WtNCv] [Woodstock][koLeSr2p] fall in this class.

&lt;!-- Synopsis: Biggs the rebel discovers advanced weaponry that he wants to use against the British when he is confronted with Pontiac's War.

Summary: Biggs is a former clergy who turned rabid anti-British patriot. He shows up at his brother's door while being pursued by Hunter, and flees when he finds his brother is Loyalist and turned him in, only to be chased by Indians and falls into a pit where he discovers advanced weaponry. He tries to smuggle the weapons back to his Sons of Liberty friends only to be exposed by a mole within the organization and sentenced to be hanged. Before the sentence could be carried out, Pontiac's War erupts and distracts the British, and Biggs decides to help the British against the Indians by giving up the weaponry which requires sneaking past the indians and then lifting the siege.

The colonies of New York (West of the Hudson, Manhattan, &amp; Long Island), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are consolidated into the Province of Pennsylvania. The Western border was fixed with Charlotina where Pennsylvania remain East of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers and Charlotina is to the West. A true North-South line is drawn from the easternmost end of Lake Erie to the Allegheny River.
Pennsylvania divided their Provincial Assembly seats equally among the former colonies. There is friction as Manhattan &amp; Long Island seek to be independent.

            <Synopsis>In a cell (Research jails in Philadelphia circa 1770), Ephraim sends word to Jeffry asking for help.
Mortimer arrives in Philadelphia and after meeting with Sharp wants to find out about the weapon. They secure the rifle and test it, with Mortimer having a thumb incident.
Ephraim and Mortimer talk about the rifle, and Mortimer tries to get him drunk, only to learn that Ephraim has a high alcohol tolerance. They argue about British authority instead. "Your sentence will be carried out." "I've not been tried yet." "You were in absentia."
Meanwhile, Kariwase involved in another attack somewhere, and we find that he is up-and-coming and very anti-European.
Jeffry arrives in Philadelphia and tries to find a way to help his brother; finding out that Mortimer might let Ephraim free if the Temple's location was revealed. But, Ephraim refuses to help the British.
Meanwhile, news of Pontiac's raids reach Philadelphia, alerting to the need to take action. LOCAL COMMANDER realizes there are insufficient troops to protect the interior, when Boydell mentions the weapons.
This renews pressure to divulge the location, and when confronted about the facts (which he wants to doubt but for Jeffry's fear), Ephraim surrenders the weapon cache's location.</Synopsis>

            <Text>#### Neutrino Energy

Neutrino energy is a theoretical way of converting the kinetic energy of cosmic into into direct current (DC) electricity.
The energy is converted by layers a conductive film, silicone film and graphene film. The conductive film comprises silver, gold, copper, gallium or aluminum or one of their alloys, in particular of a silver or gold alloy or an aluminum-gallium alloy. Each film layer is very fine, measured in 100s of nanometers. See Neutrino Power Cube[sec:neutrino-power-cube] for the scientific application.

IRL Research:

* The neutrino is the source of abundant, clean, renewable energy.[^nutrino-energy]
* Neutrinovoltaic - a low voltage system of 12/24/48V DC
* **Neutrino Film** is "a film made of metal or a metal alloy, in particular a film made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy, a so-called neutrino or ntrino film (registered trademarks), to a method of production and to a use of a film made of metal or a metal alloy." [^WO2016142056A1]
* **Neutrino Power Cubes** are highly sophisticated power cells that have the advantage of being able to supply energy in complete darkness. They do this by harnessing the kinetic energy created by invisible waves of cosmic radiation, transforming it into micro-vibrations in a complex resonation process facilitated by super-symmetrical coatings on a stable substrate. And because these power cells can be stacked on top of one another, they are more compact and efficient than today’s solar cells and far less easily damaged.[^Neutrino-energy]
* **Neutrino Energy Harvesting** is when energy can be derived from many different sources such as radio waves, vibrations, heat, or light, and these sources can be either natural or artificial. Solar cells convert light; thermoelectric generators convert heat flux (temperature differences); and Neutrino Power Cubes convert vibrations caused by neutrinos and anti-neutrinos into electricity.[^Neutrino-Wiki]

            <Text>#### Slower-than-Light Travel

Slower-than-light travel follows the IRL laws of physics. Access to Toltec technology accelerates research, leading to efficient "Edison" drives.

##### Travel Times

The table below describes the constraints of space travel. Most space ships are fuel constrained based on their acceleration ability, shown by the Duration. Travel between Earth and the slipsteam is within the limits of those ships. Those with extended durations can travel four times further than regular ships, at the expense of crew comfort. Those ships could safely make it to Uranus and back, but not to the Oort cloud.

* Civilian ships have a maximum acceleration of V-shift 3.
* Military ships have a maximum acceleration of 2G (V-shift 5.
* Slipknot (5AU), Moon, Mars (1.5AU), Uranus (19AU), Oort (0.3ly) columns all refer to travel time from Earth to those (average distance) locations. Distances between planets,[^sol-distance] Oort[^oort-distance] and Belt (1AU) [^belt-distance] are estimated for the sake of simplicity.

The table below describes the travel time between Earth and the target, as provided by the Space travel calculator.[^stl-calc]

The main (or core) population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, which are based on what is known as “Kirkwood gaps”. Named after Daniel Kirkwood, who announced in 1866 the discovery of gaps in the distance of asteroids, these gaps are similar to what is seen with Saturn’s and other gas giants’ systems of rings. https://www.notion.so/1f5ce610ebbb44d68c53e3d4c847c22d

### Crapsack World

No hope. No release. No end.

A Crapsack World is a horrible setting where the [jaded][ePTfNtdX] notion of "[anything that can go wrong][I3Ldx0jE] will go *horribly* wrong" almost always applies, and it corrupts its inhabitants into [perpetuating that nastiness against each other][1Sy0R36I]. More succinctly, trying to survive in one of these places [is gonna suck][Db2q9fwk].

Although there are countless ways Crapsack Worlds can be depicted (often with [Scenery Gorn][Hh9OorUp]), it is usually [dark][r8lLOVGL], and on the [cynical end][HKhdU7zQ] of the [Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism][IxUrvxaF], so it will have either [Grey and Gray Morality][wx6HoZB4] or [Black and Gray Morality][5wNVLRmr], if not outright [Evil vs. Evil][V1pefCi1] in the worst of cases (beware of [Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy][k12HagWl] if you decide to go this route though). Settings like these are not kind at all to [idealists][4oJl3Bdd], who usually get [traumatized][6q1GEDBT] and/or [die horribly][fLUU4loW] when their attempts to change the world through idealism meet tragic ends.

Heroes in this setting are usually [Anti Heroes][5yjINdme], and often have at least a bit of the [Deadpan Snarker][r1dVAyv9] about them. [Being good will suck][IE2XJflS], and if there are genuinely good heroes in this setting, expect them to be [Knights In Sour Armor][b8Jdn16A] and/or [Hurting Heroes][Yf865Gea]—more idealistic heroes such as the [Knight in Shining Armor][U5gJovm5] tend to not last long in this kind of setting. Any victories they manage to win over the forces of this world are likely to be [Pyrrhic][obn48Nic] in nature.

Villains tend to run the gamut from sympathetic [Anti Villains][lamexdTv] (on any level of the [Sliding Scale of Anti-Villains][nSNhRCAx]) right down to the most horrific monsters to grace any kind of media. Truly awful villains are especially common in these kinds of settings, both to represent the misery of the setting in general and to give the [Anti-Hero][5yjINdme] someone to whom he can look good in comparison. In truly extreme cases, even the most [popular][paEGHTXp] or powerful of these monsters [suffer just as badly as everyone else][bjT1r5tF]. And [Anyone Can Die][s7aV1krQ].

From here, these worlds can be depicted by authors in various ways, whether it would be dramatic or comedic, immutable or mutable. Though most of the time immutable equals dramatic, it is possible to see combinations between these categories.

- A *[dramatic][fpTmFono]* Crapsack World [has plenty][Nh1gHqHP] [of angst][3mx2ozb6] to go around, and often makes [Woobies][UxqARrDU] out of its sympathetic cast, particularly the protagonist, as they [suffer horribly][5cFuAeHk] in their attempts to do the right thing or pursue their dreams. Expect characters [who do the right thing][IE2XJflS] to [suffer for it][aGFWb63C]. Expect characters who do the wrong thing to prosper... and *[then][nGaALRCl]* [suffer][GkQxcKIy]. Examples: *[New World of Darkness][qlto3HxA]*, *[Old World of Darkness][tUKJEhnE]*, *[Sin City][9gxSPVBE]*, and *[Neon Genesis Evangelion][tdIq7bOf]*.
- A *[comedic][HoXGXFvn]* Crapsack World is [Played for Laughs][hNuFGE3r] and is made up of [idiots][6mrSMwvG], [jerks][IX7RcYGr], [Butt Monkeys][oByPkNKC], [Chew Toys][ICCLLLxv] and the occasional [Only Sane Man][5gdTwId7], with plenty of [Comedic Sociopathy][uoKomser] to go around. These include the [Black Comedy][7rTAsWtz], the [Sadist Show][PInb7WDM] and the [World Gone Mad][qLsnl5x5]. The "upside" is that it's usually [parodic][gHWpSDcA] and [funny in its extremes][tJhJHJlq]. Though people die left and right, it likely has [Negative Continuity][WPI1cSuF] to facilitate the inhabitants' suffering. Maybe a [Crapsaccharine World][VQH1YlHE]. Examples: *[Invader Zim][WHJQ2HZH]*, *[Ed, Edd n Eddy][VC8I7icF]*, *[Happy Tree Friends][jdNIQdAx]*, *[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show][XJEcoU5w]*, *[Rocko's Modern Life][S0469Z6Z]*, *[The Simpsons][G5JzEcIy]*, *[Family Guy][N3fCeesm]*, *[Matt 'n' Dusty][dGGZQ5H0]*, *[Drawn Together][WcfFqlMR]*, and *[South Park][Qs3hma9D]*. *[Paranoia][mGbJFuSQ]* is [not an example of this in the slightest.][adj5fHQm]
- An *[immutable][AkxGYLha]* Crapsack World has agony [Inherent in the System][MoBW0OXL], both physically and metaphysically, and cannot be saved or made a better place. Trying to break [The Corruption][MRdheCt2] [will instead always result][AkxGYLha] in [breaking every bone in your body][9UX3xioS] [and it winning][4y6KFlRi], and any positive changes that you try to make will ultimately be torn down and revealed to be [All for Nothing][kcPTxOAG]—or, even worse, they will only succeed in [making things even worse for you and the people that you were trying to help][P1dRVhMv], and/or [even accomplish whatever the villains wanted in the first place][sm8yYF5X]. Examples: *[Nineteen Eighty-Four][536rHcpl]*, *[Warhammer 40,000][fozFG4gj]*, *[FATAL][szNikQ0E]*, and the [Lovecraftian][DrzcDkfQ] [Fiction][ff12eY8g] genre in general.
- A *[mutable][4ZraWKYJ]* Crapsack World simply *starts out* as crappy, but a determined protagonist and his [True Companions][sYA2W3AY], be they the [Knight In Shining][U5gJovm5] (or in many of these cases, [Sour][DLryO6MZ]) [Armor][U5gJovm5] or a simple old PI, can actually cause some, but mostly few, [positive changes in the setting][lOMq0ooO]. See also [A World Half Full][Xzp0WJTE]. Examples: *[Elysium][UGJstHoE]*, *[Fallout][ctVSucoZ]*, *[Mad Max][nC02RxUk]*, and *[Waterworld][BQ2639tc]*.

This kind of world often occurs [After the End][PlDILvlz]. [Wretched Hive][MrPtsx8q] and [City Noir][sQ7ZfpwT] are city-sized versions of the Crapsack World. A [Dystopia][YfE1PWc2] is a speculative Crapsack World ruled by repressive forces modeled after real-life politics. A [Teenage Wasteland][HQBmkMUQ] is a Crapsack World run by kids. If the Crapsack World's continued misery is caused by supernatural forces, see [Dark Fantasy][qpQ3TOZ0], [Hell on Earth][hJ1pse1K] and [Cosmic Horror Story][ff12eY8g].

If a [Sugar Bowl][DUrwhASq] (usually the antithesis of this trope) turns out to be one of these under the surface, then you have yourself a [Crapsaccharine World][VQH1YlHE]. If the people who live in the Crapsack World don't realise or pretend it isn't a horrible place to be in, it is a [False Utopia][JkXIofsa]. A [Villain World][Lm8bSMWR] or [Death World][B69XJXuv] is likely to be this, and [Bad Future][rCIcFHBp] is a [Sub-Trope][bXIywgsd]. Someone who just thinks the world they inhabit is this is a [Cynic][ePTfNtdX] or a [Straw Nihilist][jx8Wr9X9] (or a [Grumpy Bear][QxKgk0Cz], if he lives in a pretty nice world).

For worlds that are almost literal sacks of crap see [The Dung Ages][PepVzKVG]. See [You Would Not Want to Live in Dex][Wm4VWN1r] for other crapsack environments. On a less negative note, the [World of Badass][iv2BaBxR] will also be likely to have elements of the Crapsack World, to give justification on why kicking ass is very important to survival. Compare [World of Jerkass][C9006hx2], a world which is only unpleasant because all of the characters are horrible people.

This trope is also known as World Half Empty, for the expression of pessimism being a state of seeing a glass with half the amount of water in it as being "half empty". Also, a half-empty glass means it can only be emptied, and can't be refilled. It represents [hopelessness][lfmHjIVr] [and inevitable doom][KjTsmpix], fitting this trope perfectly. By definition, contrast [A World Half Full][Xzp0WJTE]. [C.T. Phipps][4s0bjs10] talks about some of the appeal to the concept here. [The Appeal of Grimdark.][bYBCvbqb]

-------- ------------------------------------------------------

  1820   Electricity using hydropower. Biomass generators
         commercially available by 1839 ae This is ae ===

  1826   Oil discovered, knock 20 years off of evolution of oil

  1828   Diesel engine (called the biomass engine)

  1836   **JL Chandler reverse engineered neutrino power,
         receiving a patent on the Chandler Power Cubes. (15 June)**

  1836   Gasoline engine limited use to highly urban environments due
         to poor infrastructure and lack of access to gas.

  1839   Diesel locomotive Slow and mechanically inefficient

  1842   **First Neutrinovoltaic powered (NVP) locomotive
         using the MicroChandler Power Cube.**

  1845   Gasoline automobile limited utility in favor of biomass trucks.

  1845   **Chandler died (29 December), Chandler's patent on the CPCs lapses in 1846.**

  1859   **First Neutrinovoltaic powered (NVP) automobile by Tucker.**[^irl-electric-cars]

  1861   Latimer Clark and Sir Charles Bright coined the name "volt"
         for the unit of resistance. **This countered the growing
         interest in naming it the "Chand" or "Chandle" as part
         of the resistance to Toltec influences.
         The term was in widespread use by 1869.**

  1869   **NVP "Victoria" Taxies introduced by Walter C. Bersey** (10y early, see Images)

  1888   **NVP oceangoing ships**  (Replacing oil-burning naval ships)

##### Chandler Neutrino Power Cube {#sec:neutrino-power-cube}

**Johnathan Link Chandler** was the first to reverse engineer the Toltec Neutrino Engine (called Annichites by the Toltec), creating the Chandler Neutrino Power Cell, and Power Cubes. The NVPC (Neutrino-voltaic Power Cube) is a 2.25" cube. Chandler encased them in a thin layer of white porcelain with four brass electrodes flush with the body. This allows the cubes to be tethered to create the larger power cubes.

* Chandler Power Cube (CPC)
* Neutrino Power Cell (NPC)
* Stone (st.)

[IRL HMS Dreadnought used 17MW propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Dreadnought_(1906)). The HMS Dreadnought was launched with three 60-ton CPCs. The Titanic used five 60-ton CPCs.

When humanity found the Toltec orbitals, they saw just how closely Chandler's design worked, with a single 225-ton CPC.

### Weapons Development

Weapons development in the 19th Century accelerated based on access to working Toltec weapons. Toltecs continued to use slug-throwing weapons, so this accelerates the introduction of semi- and full-automatic weaponry. Based on the Neutrino discoveries, scientists speculate the Toltec withheld their more advanced weaponry from Earth.

#### Personal Weapons

Several weapons were found in the Toltec Indian Mound Temple. Anglo-American first reverse-engineered the actual weapon as the first generation. A second iteration led to improvements.

Table: Accelerated Personal Weapons Development

----------  ------------------------------------------------------------

  1803      Pennsylvania Toltec Arms, Ltd. (PTA Ltd.) chartered
            by Jacob Dickert and Martin Meylin Jr. to reverse-engineer
            &amp; produce Toltec weapons, moved by royal request to Harper's Ferry.
  1807      First successful reverse-engineered prototype built
  1814      PTA Ltd. completed 4,000 rifles Harper's Ferry Model 1803,
            a.k.a. Toltec Battle Rifle Model '03 (HFM-03, TBRM-03 or BRM-03)
            Essentially the StG-44. This is a straight reverse-engineer.
  1815      Battle of Waterloo turned by use of the BRM-03
  1815      PTA Ltd. charter revoked. Crown forms "Harpers Ferry Arsenal"
            with the same leadership
  1819      The Model 1819 (M1819, AK-47) "Hall Rifle" replaces the BRM-03
  1808-17   Semi-automatic pistols reverse engineered and improved,
            essentially the boxy Glock is the improved result.

#### Field Artillery

The cannon was quickly replaced by what we would consider modern field artillery.

"*...we now live in a world where kings and noblemen rule the roost. And they've turned all of central Europe — **our home, now, ours and our childrens' to come** — into a raging inferno. We are surrounded by a Ring of Fire. Well, I've fought forest fires before. So have lots of other men in this room. The best way to fight a fire is to start a counterfire. So my position is simple. I say we start the American Revolution — a hundred and fifty years ahead of schedule!*"

The problem with the past is that it's so uncivilized, but any time traveler worth their salt can fix that. Just introduce it to the delights of modern technology, several centuries early. You may need to go through a few intermediate stages, replicating the history of technology on fast forward, but you know exactly what needs doing. How difficult can it be?

There are two types of time travelers who try this stunt - the unwilling ones, [Trapped in the Past][askHV3lK] with [just the right skills needed to jump start the industrial revolution][5L3MU579], and the reckless ones who don't care about paradoxes, they just want to rewrite history for the better.

Either way, this is a long term plan. Even optimistic heroes will expect to take a few years to get the desired results. Realistic ones will consider it a lifetime's work. The hero can't leap straight to modern technology; [they have to get the past society to go through all the intermediate steps first][S3PpCKJX], or they won't have the necessary tools to make the tools to do the job. As such, this is typically the plot of an entire book, or even a series.

[Ancient Astronauts][9fxRzT6A] and explorers rediscovering [lost colonies][M0WCmQYS] occasionally fall into the trope, if the story goes into detail about how they introduce technological advances, but they normally gloss that over. By contrast, works in this subgenre typically go into great details about the new technologies being introduced to the past, and their social impact, as well as addressing all the problems that would realistically crop up.

If the strand party has a phone to a high-tech society, whether in the future or on another world, this trope can still apply. The phone can provide them with all the information they need, but they still have to deal with the immense practical problems involved in getting from medieval to modern technology. It would still take decades to get 14th century England from church bells to digital clocks, even with an internet connection to the present day, and the full resources of the kingdom at your disposal. However, if the strand party can get actual physical objects from their high-tech friends, the difficulties melt away, and this trope does not apply.

If a Hero succeeds, there's still a risk of [going horribly wrong][PNef0Ya1], [going horribly right][eruRVYhM], or both.

If the Hero went back in time with the purpose of using this trope to change history (such as preventing the Fall of Constantinople by going back to 1453 and giving the city's defenders modern weaponry and teaching them modern tactics), then it also counts as trying to [Set Right What Once Went Wrong][Hw8k4SGW] (or [Make Wrong What Once Went Right][WLyUScor], depending on the perspective).

[Fridge Logic][jB2Md24t] would dictate that this would result in an infinite technological loop: Suppose the radio was invented back in 50 B.C. by a time traveler. Since this means that time travel is possible, eventually somebody from the future of the timeline created by the original time traveler would travel back to an even earlier time (for example, 800 B.C.) and give radio to the Akkadians or something. Then a time traveler from *that* timeline would introduce radio even father back, repeating until the very first generation of humans ever to evolve is given advanced technology and civilization.

#### Compare with:

- [A Little Something We Call "Rock and Roll"][CbKXuNTf]: When this is done with pop culture instead of technology.
- [Low Culture, High Tech][p1wJgfgd]: Will result if the time traveler *doesn't* lay the groundwork for the low tech people to properly replicate the future tech.

#### Contrast with:

- [This Is My Boomstick][qwhaYt80]: The Hero only wants to impress the locals short-term.
- [Cargo Cult][57JA3WmL]: The primitive culture gets technology but concludes that the artifact is a god.

TBD, 2020 Thank you for reading through to the end. I originally wrote and released Bellicose with no professional editing in 2013. I didn't know if anyone would want to read it. If you've seen the Amazon feedback before 2020, the story was decent but the editing lacking. While I started a revision in 2017, I let life get in the way---a new house, more education, work, family. I even started a new series hoping Bophendze could get some rest. He takes a lot of abuse to go from being a kid to a marine. The other series is an alternate history set in mid-18th Century North America. Let me know if you're interested in reading it?

But, Bophendze and Smee insisted on telling their story. This time I'm coming back with solid editing. I removed Smee's back story. It's now a short story you get when you sign up to the newsletter. I added Pijemio's storyline because a friend said the Navy didn't get fair billing. And, I added a hook for the next Bophendze adventure Luctation.

In the 18th century, humanity discovered advanced alien technology in the Toltec Indian mounds. Over the next 150 years, society embraces the technology and develops interstellar travel via the slipstream, all while retaining paranoid nationalism. When they encounter other human settlements on alien worlds, they chose to study them out of concern that "alien" use of slipstream technology puts them at risk.

Albert Strand is a descendent of the original discoverer of the Indian mounds and lives under that shadow. Putting career before family, he lobbied hard to be assigned to the Orbital.

### Decade Dissonance

A large-scale form of [Schizo Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech).

Every country is different thanks to culture and geography, and no two cities in any one country are alike either. However some worlds can take this to extremes, making two side by side cities as different as night and day. The differences can be purely cosmetic or go all the way to lifestyle, architecture, and even technology. You can have a [Utopia](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia) city made of [Crystal Spires and Togas](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas) sitting smack dab next to a ghetto...sorry, "quaint hamlet" that [never left](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis) [The Middle Ages](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges).

The reason, if any is given, is that there's no technology trade between the countries, so any discoveries a country makes (from Agriculture to Zoology) never leave it. Other times it's a question of societal values, where the "savage" village has chosen not to develop technology in favor of peaceful agrarian lives; however you can expect them to have copious and advanced magic if it's a [Magic Versus Science](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience) setting. It's almost never purely stylistic, like [Gotham City](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman) and [Metropolis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman). Both exist in the same year and country, but one is firmly entrenched in 1920's Gothic and Noir style, while the other is an Art Deco optimistic future.

More plausible is [Used Future](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture), where one area is able to maintain a relative level of sophistication [After](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd) or [Just Before the End](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBeforeTheEnd) where others are reduced to tent villages. In these cases, advanced technology is *known of* by most, but becomes uncommon away from the advanced areas.

Compare [Low Culture, High Tech](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowCultureHighTech), where a backwards culture uses technology it doesn't understand. Possibly also a [Tomorrowland](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomorrowland).

#### Travel Times

The table below describes the constraints of space travel. Most space ships are fuel constrained based on their acceleration ability, shown by the Duration. Travel between Earth and the slipsteam is within the limits of those ships. Those with extended durations can travel four times further than regular ships, at the expense of crew comfort. Those ships could safely make it to Uranus and back, but not to the Oort cloud.

* Civilian ships have a maximum acceleration of V-shift 3.
* Military ships have a maximum acceleration of 2G (V-shift 5.
* Slipknot (5AU), Moon, Mars (1.5AU), Uranus (19AU), Oort (0.3ly) columns all refer to travel time from Earth to those (average distance) locations. Distances between planets,[^sol-distance] Oort[^oort-distance] and Belt (1AU) [^belt-distance] are estimated for the sake of simplicity.

The table below describes the travel time between Earth and the target, as provided by the Space travel calculator.[^stl-calc]

The main (or core) population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, which are based on what is known as “Kirkwood gaps”. Named after Daniel Kirkwood, who announced in 1866 the discovery of gaps in the distance of asteroids, these gaps are similar to what is seen with Saturn’s and other gas giants’ systems of rings. https://www.notion.so/1f5ce610ebbb44d68c53e3d4c847c22d

            <Text>&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
&gt; Discuss actual trends in African Slavery in Britain in this era.

Without the American Revolution, the anti-slavery movement in England starts earlier. Over this 50-year period (1772-1848), slavery was eliminated throughout the British Empire.

* 1772 - Somerset's Case holds there is no basis for slavery in English law, and held that laws supporting slavery were against Natural Law. This extends to BNA.
* 1787 - Wilberforce's Anti-Slavery Society struggled against London Society of West India Planters and Merchants who fought against abolition of slavery.
* 1807 - During a break in the French Troubles, England de-legalizes trans-shipment of slaves on the Oceans and between non-connected provinces.
* 1833 - "Apprenticeship Act of 1833" ends slavery in all British holdings by stages &amp; "apprenticeships." Chattel is immediately repudiated by Parliament, meaning that African children were born free. Slave owners were mollified by a tax break for each freeborn child. Slave owners were compensated by tax. American high-society slave owners were well-compensated, lower-class owners were not, leading to some animosity. Increased investment in Toltec technology helps blunt the need for slaves during the Apprenticeship Period (1833-1846).
* 1846-48 - Apprenticeships ended in American provinces (Virginia, Carolina, Georgia) to increase representation in Parliament, leading to local civil conflicts in each province by the lower class "masters," which was put down by General Scott.

This included all land South of the St. Lawrence, which extends to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and parts of Quebec. All land east of the Hudson becomes New England as well, except for Manhattan and Long Island. This led to considerable resistance by the Sons of Liberty, and led a small rebellion put down by Virginia and Pennsylvania.
