## Executive Summary[^1]

Self-published authors and freelance editors lack a unified platform to work together resulting in a complicated interaction mechanism that frustrates both author and editor alike. By providing a cross-platform, collaborative self-publisher book creation and production platform that helps authors and editors find each other and collaborate, we intend to streamline the interaction between parties, increasing the book’s value and editor’s and author’s quality of life. Verkilo’s objective is to provide a “One-Stop Book Project Production” platform with the attributes of a social media and match-making collaborative interface.  The author can go from Ideation to Distribution-Ready within one integrated platform, finding & collaborating with available, qualified & eager editors. The United States self-published market generates $9.1B annually in book sales. Through aggressive marketing and best-of-breed product offering, we believe we can obtain 8 percent market penetration in five years with $40M in gross revenue. Our ideal exit strategy would be acquisition by Amazon by Year 4 or 5.


### Problem

**History of Self-Publishing.** Johannes Gutenberg launched the publishing industry in 1439 when he became the first European to use the movable type printing press.[^2] This made the written word widely accessible to the ordinary person, but capital expenses centralized production in large companies. The digital revolution of the 1990s inaugurated the modern self-publisher movement. This lowered the capital expense barrier, bringing content production to the ordinary person.



*   Self-Publishing 1.0: Desktop publishing (MS Word)  and Print-On-Demand (POD).
*   Self-Publishing 2.0: Introduction of electronic books and online retailers.
*   Self-Publishing 3.0: Direct sales from author to reader, true self-publishing, provided by major online retailers such as Amazon.



---


*   **_Self-Publishing 4.0_: Verkilo delivers a single platform for authors and their editors to move their book through the development lifecycle from ideation to publication on one platform.  The Author-Editor Convergence!**


### Solution

Verkilo is a fully-integrated book production platform, carrying the creative work from Ideation to Publication. Our platform helps authors and editors by leveraging machine-learning technology utilizing industry-leading reinforcement and sentiment training models for matchmaking to pair them at the optimal time frame, ergo. when the book is ready for editing and the editor is ready for a new project.

**Market. **The self-publishing market today comprises a third of the US publishing market, representing $9.1 billion of the $26 billion in gross annual revenue in the US.[^3] Broadening the market globally reveals a total potential market of $1.7 trillion with 45% of authors being self-published. Verkilo seeks to enter this market and obtain 8 percent reach in five years.

**Competition.** Authors as a market niche rely on Self-Publishing 1.0 products (Microsoft Word, Google Docs), with a few using more current word processing software such as Scrivener. Some use Vellum for formatting. There are several author/editor matchmaking sites, with Reedsy having better market penetration than most. There is no single product that integrates the entire author production pipeline for the self-published market. IngramSpark is the only traditional publisher with significant penetration in the self-published market, and they limit their offering to _ala carte_ services for fee with the promise of books being available in bookstores in a way not likely with Amazon.


### Financial Highlights

Verkilo seeks $2 Million as an investment for 12.5 percent equity. All investors are offered equity in the firm. We realize revenue through a fee structure around the editing process, with an estimated cost of $200 per book and other fees. We expect 8 percent market share to generate $28 million in revenue, with $3 million in total expenses.

## Opportunity


### Problem Worth Solving

The book publishing industry is a $1.7 trillion global industry, with 45 percent of authors self-publishing. The US market is $28 billion with self-published authors representing 35 percent of the market.[^4] This means one million books need to be written and edited each year by self-managed producers.

Production quality perennially challenges self-published authors. This requires freelance editors, who are likewise challenged with marketing to these authors. Once editors attract a self-published author, they are challenged by these authors having unrealistic schedule expectations and lack of author discipline with changing a draft after it has been submitted. This results in work-life balance complaints among freelance editors and low-quality published books for the market. By solving this problem, we help self-published authors work more collaboratively with freelance editors, which improves the quality of books, & work-life balance, and increases earnings by both parties.

	Our research indicated the bigger problem lay in the author-editor interaction, both in the two finding one another and both of them having production schedules in alignment. Editors represent the higher potential revenue source between the two constituencies. Therefore, our solution focuses more on satisfying the editor, but does so in a way that draws the author onto the platform.


### Our Solution

Verkilo is a cross-platform, collaborative self-publisher creation and production platform that supports the author’s project from idea to publication-readiness. That is, an application (web, mobile, desktop) that writers can use to translate idea to draft that then supports author and editor working together to refine the draft until it is production-ready. This platform produces professional PDF or EPUB files. Both are used by authors to upload their content to Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) platform for sale on Amazon.


### Validation of Problem & Solution

To date, our validation of both the problem and solution comprises market research in forums with high self-published author and editor access. This includes Reddit’s r/selfpublish channel comprising 36,700 members[^5] and the 20BooksTo50K® Facebook group comprising 35,800 members.[^6] We conducted a survey of likely self-published editors via direct Facebook advertisement over a period of two weeks, who confirmed their biggest challenge was finding authors who had sufficient professionalism to work in the editor’s schedule. This challenge directly affects the editors quality-of-life and contributes most to editor frustration.


### Roadmap/Future Plans

Given Verkilo leverages a Platform business model by bringing two different market segments together, our roadmap focuses on attracting both to platform with the goal of attracting editors to platform for revenue realization.



1. Our first phase is to build the platform and the book production pipeline to attract authors
2. Our second phase expands the platform to editors.
3. Our third phase introduces the machine learning matchmaker that helps authors and editors find one another along several common criteria, including the availability of the editor in the author’s timeframe.
4. A subsequent phase could integrate marketing and advertising, helping the self-published author manage this aspect of their business. Self-published marketing today comprises Facebook, Google and Amazon ads.
5. A potential subsequent phase of establishing a platform for helping major streaming services (e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney) find marketable content; a phase that requires more research and analysis given the anticipated saturation of this market.

Our exit strategy is acquisition by Amazon, which would add distribution to the self-publishing production pipeline and carry the work from ideation through production to the reader.


## Market Analysis Summary

In order to effectively enter the market, Verkilo initially plans to target US self-published authors. By attending, and marketing to events such as NaNoWriMo and major online self-published author forums we will bring the platform to our customers. While we focus on attracting authors, we believe editors will follow. Strength of market growth in the US will enable us to broaden our target audience globally.

To improve our understanding of the market, Verkilo conducted cursory Internet searches to identify the size and value of market. We conducted a few brief online interviews with freelance editors who are among our target audience to identify the problem and value proposition, though not the technical solution. We ran a few Internet surveys to get a more objective understanding of the market problem, value proposition and suitability of solution to meet that value proposition.


### Market Trends & Growth

Self-Publishing 3.0 is where authors have access to selling platforms like Amazon. This has given self-publishers a place to easily obtain access to huge markets, as shown in the figure below. This is revolutionizing how authors are publishing.Self-publishing is the fastest growing segment in the global book printing market, at a CAGR of approximately 17 percent over the next 5 years. We want authors and editors growing on our platform. We are Self-Publishing 4.0.

Self-published authors represent 35% percent of the total US book publishing, with a total annual revenue of $9.1B. The figure below provides information on the US self-published market that provides insight into the market potential.

### Key Customers

Verkilo’s customer base falls into two major segments: self-published author and freelance editor.

**Author.** The self-published author is either a full- or part-time author. The author either is being fully compensated for managing their own writing, or dreams of doing so and is working toward it. The 20BooksTo50K® group is an example of tens of thousands of authors working together to reach that goal. Our target author seeks to write more than one book per year, with an ideal rate being four to six books per year. This segment would be monetized by low monthly subscription.

**Editor.** The freelance editor is a full- or part-time editor. Like the author, the editor has or seeks full-time compensation for helping self-published authors convert their idea into a well-edited product. Some editors are also authors, but by-and-large editors tend to congregate in the same online forums as authors, or leverage discovery platforms like Reedsy, to find their customers. This segment would be monetized by a percentage of editor revenue.


### Future Markets

**Streaming Production Company.** If successful, Verkilo would be in a unique position by having advanced insight into author writing & reading trends and access to creative content. Streaming production companies are increasingly competitive and in need of content. Being able to share our insights with streaming companies gives them early indicators of new content they need to pursue. This segment would be monetized by a percentage of streaming revenue identified by this relationship. In this scenario, Verkilo could expand services utilizing the "incubator" business model similar to Y-Combinator, Techstars and Seedcamp.


### Competition


#### Competitors & Alternatives

There are many platforms to sell your self-published book, however few currently exist to create and edit. A survey of over 200 writers confirmed that the three most-used writing platforms are MS Word, Google Docs and Scrivener; in that order and with ~80 percent using MS Word and Google Docs. Those surveyed who used other products used Vellum for formatting. Editors almost exclusively edited using MS Word, making it the market incumbent. Those who use MS Word usually self-manage the many files that comprise the draft.

Options such as Upwork or Freelance Writers Den provide editing only. Other options like Vellum and Draft 2 Digital only provide publishing services after the book is written. Verkilo’s closest competition is from Reedsy, a UK based author/editor platform that has many of the tools that Verkilo is proposing. However, authors surveyed who used Reedsy only use it to find an editor not to create and manage content.


#### Our Advantage

Verkilos creates books on multiple formats effortlessly, we will also have the ability to have live edits with the author for version control, finally our proprietary AI technology will be able to detect an author’s writing style and provide suggested edits as the writer produces. AI will also be able to predict an author's speed of writing and response to align with the proper editor. Verkilo will also attempt to become a unifying force in a fractured marketplace to bring a central platform where author and editor can find creative harmony. We are like Scrivener in that we provide full document project management to mitigate file management. We are like Vellum in that we provide a polished formatted final product. We are like Reedsy because we will pair authors and editors. Our advantage is the ability to vertically integrate the book production lifecycle from ideation to publication. All that remains is distribution, which is provided by companies like Amazon.


## Execution

**Summary.** Verkilo’s Operations plan focuses on ensuring we are able to provide our services to our customer base 24/7, wherever they choose to write. For development we are using Scaled Agile Framework. This allows us to focus on long-term objectives by executing short-term rolling-wave planning in measured steps. We will  maintain our infrastructure as code (IaC), allowing us to better manage change and re-constitute our entire ecosystem automatically. During our early stages, we will use GitHub for IT Service Management while offering a veneer that abstracts GitHub from our customers.


### Marketing Plan

Verkilo's marketing plan is comprised of three areas of focus



1. Create name and brand recognition by attending and or sponsoring national writing events such as NaNoWriMo.
2. Utilize well known authors as influencers and public sponsors of the platform. This would include creation of educational video media, sample text documentation, and whitepapers on platform use-case.
3. Targeted digital marketing on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and various forums to increase name and brand awareness among self-published authors.

### Solution Development Approach

The development team comprises an Offshore Team comprising full-time mobile software app developers and a Core Team comprising the CTO and CEO working part-time. The Offshore Team is responsible for front-end development and the Core Team for backend and proprietary development.

These two code bases will be managed via separate Github repositories to protect access to proprietary technology. We will use Codetree, a lightweight project management veneer over Github, to manage work and issues across repositories.

**Methodology.** We leverage Scaled Agile Framework as our software development methodology with a two-month program increment. This focuses on identifying and prioritizing the product features necessary to provide value to our customers using a weighted shortest job first (WSJF) to deliver maximum value quickly. We will use weekly scrums to maintain cohesion between both development teams, and focused planning every two months.

**Code Quality.** We will use Behavior-Driven Development to ensure we have automated testing covering our entire code base. Following Infrastructure as Code principles, this includes our underlying infrastructure.

**Issue Management.** We will have on-app and web feedback forms that front-end a Github repository issue management form; allowing us to manage work and feedback in the same context. Github provides automated security scanning and updates against our code base, keeping us aware of vulnerabilities as they are known (does not address Zero-Day).


### Technology

**Summary.** We provide a cross-platform user interface that supports document creation and collaboration based in JavaScript (JS). Several backend capabilities leverage native Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud functions that provide on-demand capabilities. Machine Learning and Performance Analytics are provided through Amazon SageMaker, PyTorch, and GraphQL on AWS.

Our service is decomposed into eight components listed below. Each component provides value to the customer by providing a quality user experience and one-stop interface for developing a creative project from ideation to publication.

**Composer / Autor (JS Front End).** The user interface (UI) is a cross-platform application written in Node.JS, leveraging React, Redux and other related libraries. The web application provides a single code-base for the other platforms written entirely in Javascript. We provide cross-platform support for mobile (specifically Android and iOS) via React Native. We provide desktop support via Electron.

Diagram 1 - Verkilo AWS Architecture & Author-Editor Pipeline \
(Author: Robert C. Koprowski Created by Draw.IO)

This UI provides a rich-text editor that can be used for composing, editing and commenting on the book project, leveraging UTF-8 for multi-language support, with multiple users able to collaborate in real time. Author / Editor interactions are managed on platform, with notifications. Editor availability calendar is managed in the Autor.

**Matchmaker / Kunlaboro (AWS).** The “Matchmaker” leverages predictive analytics (below) to help anticipate when an author seeks out an editor. It offers the author a set of editors identified by the audience and genre they edit for, the type of editing they provide, and their expected availability. This leverages Lambda, Docker and Python.

**Data Store / Azeno (AWS)**. AWS AppSync will be used to implement GraphQL as a query language that writes queries in an object structure over the standard text string. This will heavily reduce the complexity of normal SQL queries between the frontend and backend, which will mean lower direct costs to run API calls on AWS. As AppSync will be used as our API to handle requests from our users and retrieve appropriate data, AWS DynamoDB will be used to support the database services. DynamoDB is serverless, NoSQL database service on AWS, that will autoscale on its own and will easily integrate with AppSync. To support the “Matchmaker” machine learning model, AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) will be used as the compute resource for the integrated service offerings of Amazon SageMaker which will ingest for training, testing, and analysing the supporting data. With ECS, we will be using Docker as the container image as it is already integrated into ECS.

**Exporter / Eksporanto (AWS).** The exporter converts the stored work into publication-ready formats (PDF, EPUB, DOCX, RTF) and stores it on the author’s selected cloud storage (Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, S3). This conversion leverages Pandoc and LaTeX, with Lambda and Docker / Kubernetes orchestration for the processing container.

**Importer / Emporto (AWS).** The importer converts uploaded RTF or DOCX into our proprietary format for storage. The process leverages Pandoc, and Docker / Kubernetes for processing. We virus scan these uploaded documents. As a milestone event, we plan to implement and support a voice-to-text conversion of uploaded MP3/4 and WAV using AWS Transcribe to provide convenience for self-publishers to record thoughts and story telling. Inherently, this will assist impaired users with their inability and difficulties in self-publishing over standard-means of writing and/or typing their work.  Additional support for service include Amazon Textract (Text-Recognition), Amazon Translate (Language Translation), and Amazon Polly (Text-to-Speech)

**Account Management / Persono (AWS).** User accounts will largely be managed by AWS Cognito, a service that provides identity management and access control to our application. Account creation, user/group management, MFA, device management, password policies, and more will be managed through this service to provide layered security and basic account management of our users. Permissions/Rights will be managed in combination with a database table and AWS Cognito groups. This will allow editors and authors to have transparently different permissions and access to the same resources.

Cognito is easily integrated in iOS, Android, Web, and desktop applications “out-of-the-box”. Use of Cognito will allow the user to set these permissions based on their Verkilo subscription (time until expired, active/expired, etc.).

**Notification / Rekono (AWS).** To automate notifications to our users, as well as admins on system-level events and monitoring, we’re implementing AWS’ Simple Notification Service (SNS) in combination of AWS’ Simple Email Service. SNS/SES is easily integrated into many of the other services AWS offers, including Cognito. This will allow automated email message be sent to users for account creation directions, resetting passwords, and renew-subscription message based on expiring subscriptions. These services will also assist in security event information management, automated incident response and recovery, and other logging/monitoring needs for security-related capabilities implemented into our platform.

**Predictive Analytics / Machine Learning (AWS).** The data collected from editors and authors will include their schedule, genre and audience preferences, and past experience, which will serve as inputs for the machine learning model. The model will then begin to match similarities and “chance of matching” between the authors and editors, which will serve as the output.

The data used to train the “Matchmaker” machine learning model will be derived from data initially collected after Verkilo’s release and until it is implemented into the production environment. However, the data used to train the “Matchmaker” will be a random 80% of the collected data, and the test/validation data set will be comprised of the remaining 20%.

We will use the Amazon SageMaker Studio services to process over fifty (50) industry leading, optimised ML-based models utilizing the top three ML platforms (TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet machine learning frameworks, which are the industry preferred frameworks for text-based input, linear regression, reinforcement, and sentiment training. SageMaker Notebook, Experiment, and Debugger will be directly integrated in AWS’ Machine Learning services, which will allow quick implementation and delivery of our “Matchmaker” model and allow for a pipeline of additional data analytics and derivations of platform service metrics.


### Milestones

## Company & Management Summary


### The Management Team

Our management team comprises professionals with years of experience in providing cloud and software development expertise. We are well-suited to bring Verkilo to market, though we seek expertise in sales. Our team will be employed during the start-up period (see Start-up table). We welcome any additional person from our investor’s group that can contribute to the success of the company.

###


### Management Team Gaps

The management team has the following gaps:



*   **Chief Marketing Officer.** Verkilo lacks strong expertise in marketing and sales. At this stage in our lifecycle, we are seeking an advisor or co-founder to join us to help carry this product to our target market.
*   **Chief Financial Officer**. Verkilo lacks strong experience in Financial Planning and Risk Management. In order to mitigate this gap in expertise, we plan to outsource the entire accounting operation to CLA, LLP. CLA operates an entire business practice around offering outsourced accounting services, to include the CFO position, to small business and startups. This allows Verkilo to obtain the expertise required while keeping initial costs low.


### Personnel Plan

To meet the expanding operations requirements that Verkilo projects, talent acquisition will be necessary for nurturing creativity within the software applications platform.  Within this realm, we will look to add project leads in the following  Software Development, Database Administration, Full-Stack (Website), and Data Analytics within the United States.

In preparation for expanded business growth, upon a 1st round investment, Verkilo will intend to also outsource under these technology leads developers-for-hire from Adreno Technologies India Pvt. Ltd.  for competitive, low-cost application creation.[^10]

With the expected increase in Verkilo’s customer based, we also intend to invest in hiring customer support personnel for call centers, email support, knowledge-transfer and training purposes.

To compete in the community and establish a strong foothold for the Verkilo - Self-Publishing 4.0 platform, marketing will be essential in spreading knowledge and creating workshops, competitions, and hackathons for exposing the SP-4.0 products to new consumers (authors / editors).  We intend to hire on management level staff to oversee outsourced marketing partners from the local industry, though we have not explored this in detail yet.


### Company History & Ownership

Grown out of a desire to bring change to the self-published writing community, the management team (Birchfield, Koprowski, & Wilson) founded Verkilo in 2019 to create an innovative social platform to market.  We are currently whole-owned and completely self-funded.  To capitalize on our grassroots growth Vekilo is seeking our first round of investment to launch our production out of beta and into production.


### Business Model

Verkilo pursues a Platform business model, though with a bit of a twist.

A platform is a business model that creates value by facilitating exchanges between two or more interdependent groups, usually consumers and producers. We seek to harness and create large, scalable networks of authors and editors that can be accessed on demand. As a platform, we seek to create communities and markets with network effects that allow users to interact and transact.

Platforms Facebook, Uber, or Alibaba, typically do not directly create and control inventory via a supply chain focusing instead on connections. We are different in that we provide a means of production on top of providing a means of connection.


### Strategic Evaluation


#### Key Partners

Verkilo has two Key Partners it relies on to provide our service to our customers.



*   **Amazon Web Services.** Verkilo uses a wide range of Amazon Web Services to develop and deliver our services to our customers.
*   **Offshore Development Company.** To accelerate development of the non-proprietary technology, Verkilo will partner with an offshore development company.


#### Key Activities

Verkilo will engage in the following key activities to derive value for our customers:



*   **Author Content Storage.** Verkilo will cloud-host author content throughout the lifecycle of the product, including long-term storage.
*   **Author-Editor Matchmaking.** Our key differentiator is our ability to match author ans editor based on a series of professional and temporal criteria.
*   **Software Development.** Verkilo is a cloud-based software product company. It is the core of what we do.


#### Key Resources

Verkilo has the following key resources to create value:



*   **Brand.** As cited below, Verkilo will pursue developing a strong brand as the leader in the Self-Publishing 4.0 movement.
*   **Matchmaking Algorithm.** Our matchmaking algorithm will help differentiate us from our competitors early on, allowing us to strengthen our brand.
*   **Developers.** Our core developer team is key to developing our algorithm. As we grow, we will shift from off-shore to in-house developers.
*   **Intellectual Property.** Our other intellectual property, namely software, is key to our ability to deliver value.

### Risk Analysis & Mitigation[^11]

Startups are a bundle of risks. Verkilo is mindful of the need to look at our company in this lens. Our risk management approach looks at major aspects of a startup to determine not only how to fairly communicate those risks but also explain how the company is addressing those risks.

We adopt Leo Polovets’ risk management approach for startups.[^12] As an angel investor and venture capitalist, Mr. Polovets suggests nine aspects of a startup that should be de-risked. Each risk is scored on a Likert 1-5 scale (Very-High = 5, Very-Low =1). Focusing on systemic startup risk areas avoids a key mistake of undue resource allocation to address minor risks.[^13] The following paragraphs cover each of those areas including our score and our approach to reducing risk, sorted from high to low risk:



*   **Product/Market Fit Risk.** **Very-High**. Goal: Proving that we are building what people want. Situation: We think people will use our product based on customer surveys and interviews. Mitigation: We will mature our prototype in collaboration with early adopters, pivoting as needed to make fit.
*   **Product Quality Risk.** **Very-High**. Goal: Proving we can build a high-quality product. Situation: We have a mediocre prototype. Mitigation: Improve the prototype with a small set of our target audience.
*   **Sales Risk.** **Very-High**. Goal: Proving we can sell our product successfully. Situation: We have no sales experience. Mitigation: We seek an experienced advisor or founder to help us mature our capability.
*   **Recruiting Risk**. **High**. Goal: Proving we can grow the team effectively. Situation: We have some recruiting experience, but not specific team-building experience. Mitigation: We seek an experienced advisor or founder to help us mature our capability.
*   **Short-Term Competition Risk.** **High**. Goal: Proving we are differentiated from others in the market space. Situation: There are many competitors that are inefficient at serving our target audience, but there is some differentiation between them. Mitigation: With sales in place, establish brand perception and seek a patent on our Author-Editor match making.
*   **Long-Term Competition Risk.** **Medium**. Goal: Proving that we can position ourselves to compete successfully from copycats. Situation: We have few competitive advantages based on economies of scale, but have not yet established brand perception. Mitigation: With sales in place, establish brand perception.
*   **Market Risk.** **Low**. Goal: Proving we can execute well and become a huge company. Situation: We have conducted top-down market analysis, but not bottom-up analysis backed by experience & data. Mitigation: We will continue to improve our model via bottom-up analysis and experimentation.
*   **Team Risk.** **Low**. Goal: Proving we have a team that can achieve our vision. Situation: Our core team has technical competence in the key areas. Mitigation: None, minimal residual risk.
*   **Funding Risk.** **Very-Low**. Goal: Proving we have sufficient capital to hit our milestones need to raise more capital. Situation: We are able to identify product-market fit self-funded. Mitigation: None due to residual risk.

We realize revenue through a fee structure around the editing process. We assume an average of 50,000 words per book, which is the minimum size of a fiction novel. We estimated fees based on anticipated editing requirements of the typical self-published author, which are measured per manuscript word. Each tier of editing has different fee amounts. Developmental editing being the most involved, down to the lower level proofreading. These are multiplied by the 50,000 word count book then multiplied by the assumed probability each author would purchase each editor service type.

### Marketing Expense

Our first year’s marketing approach will focus on a set of author-specific forums so that we can build one side of the two-audience platform: authors. After the first year, we will pivot marketing to build the second side of the platform; Editors.

Marketing activities will include customer outreach for in-depth requirements gathering, search engine optimization to attract traffic, and making appearances at conferences that our target market regularly attends-Book Expo America, 20BooksTo50K Vegas, and San Francisco Writers Conference. Our release date for the first milestone for Verkilo would occur six months before NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month), which attracts over 400,000 self-published authors annually.[^14]

We anticipate reducing marketing expenses in the out-years, relying on brand strength, “refer-an-author” and platform quality to fuel word-of-mouth. The balance of our marketing expense is the salary for a Chief Marketing Officer to help more effectively communicate value to our target audience.


### Important Assumptions

Our financial plan operates on the following assumptions:



*   Verkilo assumes the historical trend in self-publishing to continue for the foreseeable future.
*   Company forecasts that there would be no unforeseen changes in technology to make our products obsolete. Our underlying software is developed in a Top-5 programming language, and we are leveraging well-established and supported AWS cloud technologies.
*   Cash flow is not expected to be a problem, with editing expenses being paid half on request, half on delivery.
*   Verkilo’s growth is based on internal financial resources. Company will budget 50% for growth and 50% from the profits as dividends after taxes (from year two forward and as long as it does not affect the planned growth of the company).
*   Verkilo’s fee structure is percentage based on industry standard editing prices.
*   Verkilo assumes authors and editors will continue to use the platform after establishing a relationship. We seek to maintain their platform engagement by providing a solid user experience.


### Financial Disclaimer

The financial projections that appear in this Business Plan are estimated revenues, expenses, and cash flow, which are based on research and the assumptions discussed throughout this Business Plan. They represent the best of management’s knowledge and belief. The Company’s expected revenues, expenses, and cash flow for the projected periods are subject to the Company’s ability to develop sales and production levels at the price and costs estimated by management. Accordingly, these projections reflect management’s estimates as of date of publication, and its expected course of action if such sales and production levels are attained at the price and costs anticipated.

These projected financial statements are for the purpose of providing updated information to existing and new investors. These projected financial statements should not be considered to be a presentation to forecast future results. Accordingly, these projections may not be useful for other purposes.

The assumptions disclosed herein are those that management believes are significant to the projections. Furthermore, even if the sales and production levels as well as the projected price and costs are attained, there will usually be differences between projected and actual results because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and those differences may be material.
