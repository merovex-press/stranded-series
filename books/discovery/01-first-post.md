**Discovery.** DUDE is a rebel on the run from HIM a UK bounty-hunter. He had been caught, and managed to escape hanging to be chased into the Ohio. He is then chased by the Iroquois, when he falls into a Toltec mound. The Iroquois don't follow out of fear of the holy site? He discovers the tech, and decides this is a way to get rid of the English. He gets back to civilization and contacts his rebel friends, but is betrayed when that friend turned out to be an English spy. He is returned to be executed by firing squad, but not before sharing the location with a fellow rebel (overheard).
