## OVERVIEW

### FORMAT

The **Historical Sci-Fi** series comprises novellas approximately 21,000 words long. This yields a read-time of about 100 minutes, and an voice-over narration time of 120 minutes.

Each episode/novella comprises either:
* 28 750-word scenes divided into a Four Acts (7 scenes per segment) with a Teaser and Epilogue
* 12 1500-word scenes divided into Four Acts, or
* 24 875-word scenes divided into Eight segments (3 scenes per segment).

There will be a defined A, B, C and maybe D story. There will be an ensemble cast, but the focus remains on the Hero.

The intent is to have four episodes written. They are all released at the same time. Then, one additional Novella every 6 weeks. This results in a 12-book year.

Five seasons, 60 books.

### AUDIENCE
<!-- Here you should clearly define your target audience; by age, demographic or interests - sometimes around  particular network, channel or medium.  You may also take into consideration the audiences of other shows and aim your project to appeal to the same audience as a similar series, or one in the same style or genre. -->

**My audience are "Protector Caste" adults seeking inspiration.** We believe that we are responsible for serving a higher purpose. We may have served in the military, but we may also be a first-responder. We want to see humanity as it is, but also how it should be. We want to be inspired and lauded for our service. We watch war movies to be inspired, not for the violence of it.

**My audience doesn't want "sin" as a focus.** We want to be uplifted, not reminded of our baser instincts. But, at the same time, we recognize that even in greatness there is weakness. We would be comfortable reading about King David and all that he failed in, but at the same time we want to see him accomplish great things. We want an example.

**My audience doesn't have time.** We're busy, easily distracted, or don't like to put a lot into reading. We want something short enough that we can read while waiting for something to happen. A novella that we can crush in 1.5 hours is perfect.

**My audience are Christians.** We are tired of seeing science fiction espouse anti-Christian philosophy. Decisions should reflect or have consequences based on Christian values.
