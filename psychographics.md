> It’s not really that hard to identify the genres of short stories. I classify about 800 stories per year, and maybe 5 are ambiguous. At least, if you use my definitions.
> The major splits are Hard vs. Soft SF and High vs. Low Fantasy. I define Hard SF as SF where the science/technology is the focus of the story. High Fantasy is fantasy set in a secondary world. Obviously there’s little confusion between those two. You’d think the challenge would be to distinguish Soft SF from Low Fantasy, but, as I said above, it’s rarely a problem. Low Fantasy is set in our world (or something close to it) but with magic and/or supernatural creatures. Soft SF may have technology that’s hard to tell from magic, but the people in the stories take it for granted and don’t think of it as magic at all.
> Future Fantasy stories, like Star Wars, where you have magic but you also have high technology are probably the most debatable, but even there it’s usually pretty clear, and, regardless, those are rare.
> **I classify Steampunk as a special type of alternate-history fantasy set in the 1800s. (I class all alternate-history under low fantasy.)** (greghullender Jan 10, 2019 @ 11:13:55)
