<!-- concept-overview -->
**Strand** is  a [low fantasy], [Type-X] [alternative-history] series written by Ben Wilson.

In the 18th Century, British-Americans uncover an [ancient acropolis] that introduces ([advanced, ancient human]) [lost technology] in the Ohio Territory at the end of the Seven Years' War. This leads to [America remaining in the UK] despite continued struggle by the Sons of Liberty. Britain becomes a [low culture, high tech] society. We have a faction (SOL) who want to divide, and a faction (Tory) who want to unite; both want to control the strange tech, but ultimately come together to keep it from the French & Indians.

Throughout the 19th Century, a secret British society reverse-engineers the [Neutrinovoltaic power][phlebotinum]. This increases degrees of separation between Britain and the rest of the world, creating a [decade dissonance]. A technological espionage struggle ensues among the great powers. The Napoleonic & Crimean wars occur per OTL, but with different outcomes. British North America starts its Western expansion, leading to the Mexican war, which becomes British.

By the 20th Century, technological equilibrium is established with Britain replicating its IRL trade dominance benefiting Europe. The UK re-invents slipstream travel, with Albert Strand ultimately stranded on Elysion and trying to get home. Belize becomes the launch region for space travel.

In Strand Series, we explore the perennial struggle of a society when its technological capabilities out-strips its morality. Most Americans do not understand the technology they use. Nor are they interested in its long-term implications. We also explore the tension between centralism/de-centralism, individualism, etc. As religion was a significant part of society, Christianity will be explored in a manner non-threatening to the reader.

We also explain how American remaining a part of Great Britain would not have hindered our global dominance. But, what about the Bill of Rights & Constitution?

## Overview

### Concept

<!-- setting-overview -->
**Stranded** is an alternate history (low-fantasy) series diverging in the 18th Century when British North America undergoes [technologic acceleration][VcUi1erb] caused by discovered lost technology. The British believe the technology to come from ancient aliens they named the "Toltec" after the native mounds where the technology was discovered; there are no aliens in the series.
Access to advanced technology early set the British on a path to global dominance unabated in the 20th Century.

In the 18th Century, Toltec discoveries led to advanced weapons (automatic rifles). In the 19th Century, Toltec Neutrinovoltaic technology accelerated the industrial era. By the early 20th Century, Brits were in space and leveraging Toltec technology for [Slipstream][ltDHHbfX] (faster-than-light) travel. Traveling the Slipsteam reveals "[Elysion][UPkFi3ZN]," an inhabited earth-like planet two knots from Earth. Afraid this was the alien homeworld, the British set up on an abandoned Toltec orbital to observe Elysion, which led to Elysian anthropology.

Elysion inhabitants are humans genetically identical to Earth. Albert encounters the Hela, a dark-skinned, Indo-European-appearing ethnicity speaking what Albert determines is an older Germanic (Icelandic) language. The Hela, technologically in the Renaissance, are in the early stages of a civil war, with a rival branch of the ruling family seeking to gain power.

<!-- /setting-overview -->

### Format

<!-- format-overview -->
**Stranded** is a novella series broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 10 novellas as "chapters." This follows the [UK drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) or [Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) series season length. (See [research](research/season-episode.md))

**Pattern.** Seasons follow three intertwined storylines: combat, espionage/technology and diplomacy.

* Combat - this storyline deals with the use of force.
* Espionage - this storyline deals with exploration and theft of the ancient technology by various factions.
* Diplomacy - this storyline addresses changes in sectarian and international politics.

**Reading Length.** A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel. (See Audience) Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but the storylines will either be incomplete or hinting at the future.

### Audience

<!-- audience -->
Readers of the **Strand** series are history buffs (especially American history), with varying religious, social and political beliefs; tending towards the left. They tend to be skeptical, educated and pro-science (even when religious).[^psychographics] They are tolerant and willing to consider other viewpoints. They are more likely to be veterans and patriotic. Strand leaders like the _feel_ of history. They like accuracy, but they accept some inaccuracy when it favors a good story.

[^psychographics]: This describes the psychographics of a sample audience who self-identify as Alt-history fans on Wikipedia.

They are fans of mainstream science-fiction & fantasy books, TV and movies. They are gamers, both computer and table-top. They are above-average intelligence. They enjoy reading. Popular TV series of **Strand** readers include:
    Turn (historical espionage),
    The Expanse (alien mystery and factious desire to dominate it),
    and Hell on Wheels (jealous factions collaborating toward a monumental goal, individuals with a dark past they are trying to live down).

## Series Plot / Outline

_**a one-page (4-5 paragraph) summary of the world, major characters and central tension.**_

<!-- Write an overview of the series idea, describing the world or setting it takes place in, the unique conflicts faced, and the dynamics between main characters that fuel the story. This is a great sales tool because you're going to highlight the most interesting facets and themes of the series. You should be able to do this in three paragraphs, but a few pages is ok so long as the writing is "tight" and reads efficiently, moving the story beat by beat. -->

In the 18th century, humanity discovered advanced alien technology in the Toltec Indian mounds. Over the next 150 years, society embraces the technology and develops interstellar travel via the slipstream, all while retaining paranoid nationalism. When they encounter other human settlements on alien worlds, they chose to study them out of concern that "alien" use of slipstream technology puts them at risk.

Albert Strand is a descendent of the original discoverer of the Indian mounds and lives under that shadow. Putting career before family, he lobbied hard to be assigned to the Orbital.

<!-- Looking at PoI's formatting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_Interest_(TV_series) -->
a 1-2 page that gives an overview of the characters, major series arcs.

1. Paragraph introduces the main character and the central series plot.
2. Paragraph explains the major characters & relationships to main character and one-another.
3. Paragraph summarizes major series sub-plots, one sentence per subplot. Highlight on the first major subplot to address.
4. Paragraph of season two summary in four sentences: the core season conflict, new characters/conflicts. Service the subplots.
5. Ditto each new season. Close each subplot introduced in the sub-plot paragraph. Introduce a new one as necessary.

## Key Characters

These are the major characters in the series and their roles.

* **[Albert Strand](./docs/03-Characters/albert-strand.md)** (seasons 3–5; guest season 1; recurring season 2)
is the descendent of one of the Slipstream discoverers. His drive to honor the family legacy leads him to turn his back on his new family and spend two years on a research orbital. As his tour wraps up, his orbital is attacked by anarchists, forcing him to abandon ship. The ship inexplicably navigates straight to the surface below. He crashes. He awakes hostage on an alien world. He uses his knowledge of advanced technology to survive. He tries desperately to develop the means to return home while trying to maneuver in the real war on the alien planet. But, he must keep the alien humans from mastering the technology and awaking the real threat to his homeworld.
* **[Clarance Dankworth](./docs/03-Characters/clarance-dankworth.md)** ()
Clarance is "Blaster" to Albert's "Master," and the reason why they had to flee New Briton Orbital. He is a _Blood Knight_, lives for fighting and battle, and has a knack for being proficient in any weapon. During the first season, he is such a loyal companion of Albert's that the natives haul him away to kill him...Rasputin style. He manages to survive, later coming back with a rebel army of sorts as an effort to save Albert. Fiercely loyal to Albert.
* **[David Strand](./docs/03-Characters/david-strand.md)** (season 1)
David Strand was a Son of Liberty, frustrated by the settled peace between America and England.

**Release.**
This repo manages Github Releases with [Release Drafter](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter). It automatically creates a `Draft` release and updates that draft with *Pull Requests*. There are pull-request-specific labels in the repo to help categorize the release notes. See [.github/release-drafter.yml](./.github/release-drafter.yml) for those labels.

`git rebase origin/master`

**Changelog.**
This repos makes the Changelog using Using [Github Release Notes](https://github.com/github-tools/github-release-notes). Changelog format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
* `gren changelog --override`
* Note: Do not use `gren release` as it will argue with Release Drafter.
* Note: I got overkill in August 2019 with v0.4.0 using `gren` to create the release (it ignored the draft release) off of commits.

**Readme Automation.** Some content in this README is pulled from the series documentation. The `make-readme.rb` custom script in `./bin` builds the readme.
