## LOGLINE

Forced to crash land, a Slipstream Anthropologist struggles to survive on an alien world that feels strangely similar.

## OVERVIEW

### FORMAT

The **Historical Sci-Fi** series comprises novellas approximately 21,000 words long. This yields a read-time of about 100 minutes, and an voice-over narration time of 120 minutes.

Each episode/novella comprises either:
* 28 750-word scenes divided into a Four Acts (7 scenes per segment) with a Teaser and Epilogue
* 12 1500-word scenes divided into Four Acts, or
* 24 875-word scenes divided into Eight segments (3 scenes per segment).

There will be a defined A, B, C and maybe D story. There will be an ensemble cast, but the focus remains on the Hero.

The intent is to have four episodes written. They are all released at the same time. Then, one additional Novella every 6 weeks. This results in a 12-book year.

Five seasons, 60 books.

<!-- The Format of your series encompasses a number of structural elements of your series. These include:
- The Length of episodes
- The Number of episodes
- The Structure of the episodes and their story arcs
- The Genre of the series
- The Release pattern of episodes (how often and how spaced apart) -->

### AUDIENCE
<!-- Here you should clearly define your target audience; by age, demographic or interests - sometimes around  particular network, channel or medium.  You may also take into consideration the audiences of other shows and aim your project to appeal to the same audience as a similar series, or one in the same style or genre. -->

**My audience are "Protector Caste" adults seeking inspiration.** We believe that we are responsible for serving a higher purpose. We may have served in the military, but we may also be a first-responder. We want to see humanity as it is, but also how it should be. We want to be inspired and lauded for our service. We watch war movies to be inspired, not for the violence of it.

**My audience doesn't want "sin" as a focus.** We want to be uplifted, not reminded of our baser instincts. But, at the same time, we recognize that even in greatness there is weakness. We would be comfortable reading about King David and all that he failed in, but at the same time we want to see him accomplish great things. We want an example.

**My audience doesn't have time.** We're busy, easily distracted, or don't like to put a lot into reading. We want something short enough that we can read while waiting for something to happen. A novella that we can crush in 1.5 hours is perfect.

**My audience are Christians.** We are tired of seeing science fiction espouse anti-Christian philosophy. Decisions should reflect or have consequences based on Christian values.

### CREATORS STATEMENT
_The Creators Statement is an opportunity to clearly and succinctly spell out the thematic and conceptual ideas and premise behind your series. What are the metaphors and philosophies embedded in your story? How do your characters reflect the questions you wish to explore? What are the underlying beliefs that drive the story?_

### LOOK AND FEEL
_The Look + Feel section details the intended visual aesthetics of your series. What is the Style of the show, how will it appear to audiences? What are the techniques, colors, compositions, and visual influences on the series?_

### VISUAL REFERENCES
_A visual gallery of images that provide a mood-board and visual guide to the aesthetic style of the show. Interiors, exteriors, tones, texture, style, costume and design. This may also include images and elements drawn from other productions or artists that ‘resonate’ with you as relevant or informative to your project._

## SYNOPSIS
<!-- The Synopsis of your series is short document of less than 1 page (4-5 paragraphs) that summarizes the world of the story, the major characters and the central tension. -->

The year is 1907. Kaius Minjen, a Slipstream Anthropologist running from his past, lands a plum appointment to the Migdal Orbital to observe the Migdalians. Anarchists slip in and attack the station, forcing him to abandon and land on the surface.

## SETTING

_Setting details the time, place and period of your series - the Where and When. The length of this document can vary depending on the genre of the series. A SciFi drama for example may need detailed description of the setting where as a suburban drama in the present day may be relatively short._

### Tropes

Look at the [Mohs Scale of Violence](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfViolenceHardness)

I write in the [Romantic](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment) vein (Romanticist-themed science fiction might portray the future as an unpleasant Crapsack World, with high technology but low social quality, full of depression, dehumanization and alienation (e.g. everything Cyberpunk) with the happy souls being those who escaped to the countryside, if possible)

* [Lost Technology](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology) - The hero comes from a society that got a leapfrog in technology from the ancients. Results in
* [Steampunk](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk) and [Steampunk Index](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteampunkIndex)
* [Insufficiently Advanced Alien](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufficientlyAdvancedAlien) - Humanity is able to travel, but lacks sufficient technology to do much else.
* [God Guise](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise) - Hero takes advantage of false god worship due to [This is my Boomstick](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMyBoomstick). But, by the end of the first season....
* [Unwanted Faith](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith) he no longer wants to be worshipped, but a religion has formed.
* [One Small Fib (4.5)](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Mohs/OneBigLie) - FTL travel, not significant to the plot.
