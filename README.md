## Overview

### Concept

<!-- setting-overview --><!-- auto-populated -->


**Stranded** is an alternate history setting diverging in the 18th Century after [technologic acceleration][VcUi1erb] in British North America. The British believe the technology to come from ancient aliens they named the "Toltec" after the native mounds where the technology was discovered; there are no aliens in the series.
Access to advanced technology early set the British on a path to global dominance unabated in the 20th Century.

In the 18th Century, Toltec discoveries led to advanced weapons (automatic rifles). In the 19th Century, Toltec Neutrinovoltaic technology accelerated the industrial era. By the early 20th Century, Brits were in space and leveraging Toltec technology for [Slipstream][ltDHHbfX] (faster-than-light) travel. Traveling the Slipsteam reveals "[Elysion][UPkFi3ZN]," an inhabited earth-like planet two knots from Earth. Afraid this was the alien homeworld, the British set up on an abandoned Toltec orbital to observe Elysion, which led to Elysian anthropology.

Elysion inhabitants are humans genetically identical to Earth. Albert encounters the Hela, a dark-skinned, Indo-European-appearing ethnicity speaking what Albert determines is an older Germanic (Icelandic) language. The Hela, technologically in the Renaissance, are in the early stages of a civil war, with a rival branch of the ruling family seeking to gain power.

### Format

<!-- Like Wikipedia: Discworld Composition -->
<!-- format-overview --><!-- auto-populated -->

**Stranded** is a series of novellas, broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 12 novellas as "chapters." This follows the [UK drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) or [Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) series season length. (See [research](research/season-episode.md))

A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel (TODO: [#31](https://github.com/Merovex/stranded-series/issues/31), audience psychographics). Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but leave the reader wanting the next one.

This is an alt-history Science Fiction series. Need to explain the genre (horror, comedy, etc.) Loop in the major tropes.

### Audience

<!-- audience --><!-- auto-populated -->

In AUDIENCE you should clearly define your target audience; not just by age or gender but also by demographic, interests, habits, other media they consume, other activities they engage, what professions they occupy, what beliefs or values they may hold. Audiences are not so simplistic as to be defined simply by how old they are and what sex they are…!

Also take into consideration the audiences of other shows and aim your project to appeal to the same audience as a similar series, or one in the same style or genre.

If possible specify the network, broadcaster or channels most appropriate.

## Series Plot / Outline

_**a one-page (4-5 paragraph) summary of the world, major characters and central tension.**_

<!-- Write an overview of the series idea, describing the world or setting it takes place in, the unique conflicts faced, and the dynamics between main characters that fuel the story. This is a great sales tool because you're going to highlight the most interesting facets and themes of the series. You should be able to do this in three paragraphs, but a few pages is ok so long as the writing is "tight" and reads efficiently, moving the story beat by beat. -->

In the 18th century, humanity discovered advanced alien technology in the Toltec Indian mounds. Over the next 150 years, society embraces the technology and develops interstellar travel via the slipstream, all while retaining paranoid nationalism. When they encounter other human settlements on alien worlds, they chose to study them out of concern that "alien" use of slipstream technology puts them at risk.

Albert Strand is a descendent of the original discoverer of the Indian mounds and lives under that shadow. Putting career before family, he lobbied hard to be assigned to the Orbital.

<!-- Looking at PoI's formatting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_Interest_(TV_series) -->
a 1-2 page that gives an overview of the characters, major series arcs.

1. Paragraph introduces the main character and the central series plot.
2. Paragraph explains the major characters & relationships to main character and one-another.
3. Paragraph summarizes major series sub-plots, one sentence per subplot. Highlight on the first major subplot to address.
4. Paragraph of season two summary in four sentences: the core season conflict, new characters/conflicts. Service the subplots.
5. Ditto each new season. Close each subplot introduced in the sub-plot paragraph. Introduce a new one as necessary.

## Key Characters

These are the major characters in the series and their roles.

<!-- major-character-section --><!-- auto-populated -->
* **[Albert Strand](./docs/03-Characters/albert-strand.md)** (seasons 3–5; guest season 1; recurring season 2)
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

* **[Clarance Dankworth](./docs/03-Characters/clarance-dankworth.md)** ()
Clarance is "Blaster" to Albert's "Master," and the reason why they had to flee New Briton Orbital. He is a _Blood Knight_, lives for fighting and battle, and has a knack for being proficient in any weapon. During the first season, he is such a loyal companion of Albert's that the natives haul him away to kill him...Rasputin style. He manages to survive, later coming back with a rebel army of sorts as an effort to save Albert. Fiercely loyal to Albert.

## Key Locations

KEY LOCATIONS lays out the central narrative spaces in the series, the recurring locations that are important to the characters and the world and the dominant locations where the story will play out.

In a good series these Locations will not be arbitrary - they will be specifically chosen for their natural dramatic pressures, their stylistic or aesthetic significance to the narratives, or their metaphoric relationship to characters, contexts and themes.

This section should list the locations and provide a 1-2 paragraph description of each.

<!-- location-section --><!-- auto-populated -->
* **[Crown Victoria Orbital](./docs/04-Locations/Earth/crown-victoria-orbital.md).** Crown Victoria Orbital is the Toltec orbital over Earth.
* **[Elysion System](./docs/04-Locations/Elysion/elysion-system.md).** Elysion is a binary system (G2V, KV5). Third planet around Elysion Junior is Elysion, the focal planet for the system.
* **[New Briton Orbital](./docs/04-Locations/Elysion/new-briton-orbital.md).** New Briton Orbital is the Toltec orbital over Elysion that allows the British to observe the planet below

**Release.**
This repo manages Github Releases with [Release Drafter](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter). It automatically creates a `Draft` release and updates that draft with *Pull Requests*. There are pull-request-specific labels in the repo to help categorize the release notes. See [.github/release-drafter.yml](./.github/release-drafter.yml) for those labels.

**Changelog.**
This repos makes the Changelog using Using [Github Release Notes](https://github.com/github-tools/github-release-notes). Changelog format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
* `gren changelog --override`
* Note: Do not use `gren release` as it will argue with Release Drafter.
* Note: I got overkill in August 2019 with v0.4.0 using `gren` to create the release (it ignored the draft release) off of commits.

**Readme Automation.** Some content in this README is pulled from the series documentation. The `make-readme.rb` custom script in `./bin` builds the readme.
