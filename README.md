## GENRE

STRANDED is a "one-small-fib" science-fiction novella series that mixes elements of Steampunk with faster-than-light travel and tinged with [Romanticism](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment). The average read-time for an episode is 90-120 minutes (21-29,000 words).

The one word for this series is regret.

[Romanticist-themed science fiction might portray the future as an unpleasant [Crapsack World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld), with high technology but low social quality, full of depression, dehumanization and alienation (e.g. everything Cyberpunk) with the happy souls being those who escaped to the countryside, if possible]

### Key Tropes

<!-- Look at the [Mohs Scale of Violence](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfViolenceHardness) -->

* [Lost Technology](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology) - The hero comes from a society that got a leapfrog in technology from the ancients. Results in
* [Steampunk](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk) (See [index](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteampunkIndex))
* [Insufficiently Advanced Alien](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufficientlyAdvancedAlien) - Humanity is able to travel, but lacks sufficient technology to do much else.
* [God Guise](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise) - Hero takes advantage of false god worship due to [This is my Boomstick](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsMyBoomstick). But, by the end of the first season....
* [Unwanted Faith](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith) he no longer wants to be worshipped, but a religion has formed.
* [One Small Fib (4.5)](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Mohs/OneBigLie) - FTL travel, not significant to the plot.
* Knight in Sour Armor - The world is filled with idealists who believe in truth and justice and devote their lives to fighting for it. And then the world keeps letting them down. For them, Being Good Sucks. But rather than giving up on their goals, they replace their shiny armor with a full plate of pure cynicism. These characters realize they live in a dark, cruel and brutal world and choose to fight not because they believe they will truly make a difference, but because it's the right thing to do.

## LOGLINE (1-2 sentence)

When a slipstream Anthropologist crash-lands on an alien world he was observing, he must struggle to adapt to his new environment and find a way back home.

## SUMMARY (one-paragraph)

Albert Harred nears the end of a two-year tour as a Slipstream Anthropologist studying a pre-industrial society, when he is forced to crash land after his station is attacked by Anarchists. On surface, he struggles to adapt to an alien society where he increasingly is viewed as a god. This drags him into a cold war between two nations at a time when he hopes to find technology to get him home. He finds the technology and mirrors the approach his own world took when they learned to get to space. The war heats up and he (maybe) escapes and returns home...returning to a world wracked by war and confronted with the risk of his having empowered a more potent threat.

## MILIEU

### SETTING

_Setting details the time, place and period of your series - the Where and When. The length of this document can vary depending on the genre of the series. A SciFi drama for example may need detailed description of the setting where as a suburban drama in the present day may be relatively short._

The [Eutanio Empire](/docs/setting/great-powers-of-lur.md#eutanio-empire) emerged from a series of [Hasierian imperial struggles](#) as a great power due to its industrialization and naval dominance. Fueled by these successes, they embarked in exploration and archeology. Their explorers [discovered alien technology in ancient temples](#), accelerating their technological growth. Other [great powers](#) struggled to catch up by espionage and exploration, with the [Sakumani Empire](#) being the most successful.

This setting is similar to 19th century Earth and European great powers. As such, this is an era of very-limited democracy, rabid nationalism, and unchecked technological growth tinged with apocalyptic fears. Traditional religion, already in decline after the imperial struggles, was effectively killed by the discoveries; with a new religion based on the alien technology emerging.

Technologically, the imperial struggles transitioned Hasierian from smoothbore weapons to American Civil War technology all based on steam. The Alien technology automated the weapons to modern-era assault weapons, but the infrastructure to support more than coal/steam technology has not been developed; and the nationalist competition checks Eutanian moves to build out that technology. Eutaino has sufficient means to build out its space program, which is a bit of an irony, with launches occurring from the equivalent of Africa.



### WORLD + BACKGROUND

The World + Background section outlines the world of your series going beyond the Where and When to encompass the Why - the circumstances, rules and given principles of the world your story plays out in. Consider:

- The Events that have lead to the current ‘situation’
- The Backstory of the characters
- Social groupings and hierarchies
- Character and World Relationships
- Established Behaviors and Attitudes
- Rules that govern the Tone of the story (certain types of humor, language, inflections)

## SERIES OUTLINE

_The Series Outline is a self contained document of 1-2 pages that overviews character and narrative arcs over the course of the series. Much like a feature-film Treatment it focuses on the major events and the journey of the protagonists._

## KEY LOCATIONS

_Key Locations lays out the central locations in the series, the recurring locations that are important to the characters and the world and the dominant locations where the story will play out. This section should list the locations and provide a 1-2 paragraph description of each._
