## FRANCHISE

STRANDED is a "one-small-fib" science-fiction novella series that mixes elements of Steampunk with faster-than-light travel and tinged with [Romanticism](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment).

[Romanticist-themed science fiction might portray the future as an unpleasant [Crapsack World](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld), with high technology but low social quality, full of depression, dehumanization and alienation (e.g. everything Cyberpunk) with the happy souls being those who escaped to the countryside, if possible]

## LOGLINE (1-2 sentence)

When a slipstream Anthropologist crash-lands on an alien world he was observing, he must struggle to adapt to his new environment and find a way back home.

## SUMMARY (one-paragraph)

Albert Harred nears the end of a two-year tour as a Slipstream Anthropologist studying a pre-industrial society, when he is forced to crash land after his station is attacked by Anarchists.

<!-- On surface, he struggles to adapt to an alien society where he increasingly is viewed as a god. This drags him into a cold war between two nations at a time when he hopes to find technology to get him home. He finds the technology and mirrors the approach his own world took when they learned to get to space. The war heats up and he (maybe) escapes and returns home...returning to a world wracked by war and confronted with the risk of his having empowered a more potent threat. -->

Albert Harred nears the end of a two-year tour as a Slipstream Anthropologist studying a pre-industrial society, when he is forced to crash land after his station is attacked. He struggles to adapt in the alien society. The striking similarities convinces him that they are connected. He quests a pyramid that he believes has the technology to lead him home.

Guma (Lord) Fadian Castrel struggles with other warlords (Counsel of Advisors to the Emperor). To survive, he must become Kerdguma (Supreme Counselor / Guardian). While a distraction, Harred's arrival in Castrel's province offers Castrel a chance to technologically leapfrog his rivals. He humors Harred's quest to return while subsequently undermining him--he fears Harred's return home would ultimately destroy Castrel's homeworld. (Similar to [William Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Adams_%28sailor%29))

* Guma (lord)
* Kerdguma (great lord) - Counselor
* Guma Fadian (shepherd) Castrel (bird-of-prey)

### SETTING

<!-- _Setting details the time, place and period of your series - the Where and When. The length of this document can vary depending on the genre of the series. A SciFi drama for example may need detailed description of the setting where as a suburban drama in the present day may be relatively short._ -->

**Slipstream History.** The [Eutanio Empire](/docs/setting/great-powers-of-lur.md#eutanio-empire) emerged from a series of [Hasierian imperial struggles](#) as a great power due to its industrialization and naval dominance. Fueled by these successes, they embarked in exploration and archeology. Their explorers [discovered alien technology in ancient temples](#), accelerating their technological growth. Other [great powers](/docs/setting/great-powers-of-lur.md) struggled to catch up by espionage and exploration, with the [Sakumani Empire](/docs/setting/great-powers-of-lur.md#sakumani-empire) being the most successful.

This setting is similar to 19th century Earth and European great powers. As such, this is an era of very-limited democracy, rabid nationalism, and unchecked technological growth tinged with apocalyptic fears. Traditional religion, already in decline after the imperial struggles, was effectively killed by the discoveries; with a new religion based on the alien technology emerging.

**Technology.** Technologically, the imperial struggles transitioned Hasierian from smoothbore weapons to American Civil War technology all based on steam. The Alien technology automated the weapons to modern-era assault weapons, but the infrastructure to support more than coal/steam technology has not been developed; and the nationalist competition checks Eutanian moves to build out that technology. Eutaino has sufficient means to build out its space program, which is a bit of an irony, with launches occurring from the equivalent of Africa nearest the equator.
