## Setting Overview

<!-- setting-overview --><!-- auto-populated -->

**Stranded** occurs after 160 years of [technologic acceleration][VcUi1erb] after the English discovered [ancient technology][vLFiDV9E] in British America. The British believe the technology to come from ancient aliens they named the "Toltec" after the native mounds where the technology was discovered; there are no aliens in the series.
Access to advanced technology early set the British on a path to global dominance unabated in the 20th Century.

"Toltec" writings led to British "discovery" of the [Slipstream][ltDHHbfX], providing faster-than-light travel. Traveling the Slipsteam reveals "[Elysion][UPkFi3ZN]," an inhabited earth-like planet two knots from Earth. Afraid this was the alien homeworld, the British set up on an abandoned Toltec orbital to observe Elysion, which led to Elysian anthropology.

Elysion inhabitants are humans genetically identical to Earth. Albert encounters the Hela, a dark-skinned, Indo-European-appearing ethnicity speaking what Albert determines is an older Germanic (Icelandic) language. The Hela, technologically in the Renaissance, are in the early stages of a civil war, with a rival branch of the ruling family seeking to gain power.

## Format

<!-- Like Wikipedia: Discworld Composition -->
<!-- format-overview --><!-- auto-populated -->

**Stranded** is a series of novellas, broken down into seasons. Each season comprises 12 novellas as "chapters." This follows the [UK drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) or [Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) series season length. (See [research](research/season-episode.md))

A reader should complete a novella in roughly two hours of reading, or under four hours listening via Audible. This size was chosen to favor air travel (TODO: [#31](https://github.com/Merovex/stranded-series/issues/31), audience psychographics). Each season will be self-contained, though with storylines that may delay resolution until a subsequent series. A season climax will close out the season, but leave the reader wanting the next one.

This is an alt-history Science Fiction series. Need to explain the genre (horror, comedy, etc.) Loop in the major tropes.

* **[Clarance Dankworth](./series-bible/03-Characters/clarance-dankworth.md)** ()
Clarance is "Blaster" to Albert's "Master," and the reason why they had to flee New Briton Orbital. He is a _Blood Knight_, lives for fighting and battle, and has a knack for being proficient in any weapon. During the first season, he is such a loyal companion of Albert's that the natives haul him away to kill him...Rasputin style. He manages to survive, later coming back with a rebel army of sorts as an effort to save Albert. Fiercely loyal to Albert.
