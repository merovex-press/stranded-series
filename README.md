## Setting

<!-- setting-overview --><!-- auto-populated -->

The story occurs after 160 years of [technologic acceleration](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingRadioToTheRomans) after the English discovered [ancient alien technology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts) in British America. Access to advanced technology early set the British on a path to global dominance unabated in the 20th Century.

Toltec writings led to British "discovery" of the [Slipstream](./series-bible/08-Science-Cosmology/slipstream.md), providing faster-than-light travel. Traveling the slipsteam reveals "[Elysion](./series-bible/04-Locations/Elysion/00-elysion.md)," an inhabited earth-like planet two knots from Earth. Afraid this was the alien homeworld, the British set up on an abandoned Toltec orbital to observe Elysion, which led to Elysian anthropology.

Elysion inhabitants are humans genetically identical to Earth. Albert encounters the Hela, a dark-skinned, Indo-European-appearing ethnicity speaking what Albert determines is an older Germanic (Icelandic) language. The Hela, technologically in the Renaissance, are in the early stages of a civil war, with a rival branch of the ruling family seeking to gain power.

## Format

### Clarance Dankworth (ally)

Clarance is "Blaster" to Albert's "Master," and the reason why they had to flee New Briton Orbital. He is read and willing to fight, and has a knack for being proficient in any weapon. During the first season, he is such a loyal companion of Albert's that the natives haul him away to kill him...Rasputin style. He manages to survive, later coming back with a rebel army of sorts as an effort to save Albert. Fiercely loyal to Albert.
