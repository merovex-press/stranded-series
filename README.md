## Concept

### Logline

A homesick slipstream scientist watches an alien society from space. When his orbital is attacked, he is forced to abandon ship and finds himself stranded on the planet's surface.

<!-- Write a short and powerful description of the core concept. Two sentences is ideal. A logline for a scripted series will often describe the main character's plight and unique circumstance that drives the story.  -->

### Synopsis

<!-- Write an overview of the series idea, describing the world or setting it takes place in, the unique conflicts faced, and the dynamics between main characters that fuel the story. This is a great sales tool because you're going to highlight the most interesting facets and themes of the series. You should be able to do this in three paragraphs, but a few pages is ok so long as the writing is "tight" and reads efficiently, moving the story beat by beat. -->

In the 18th century, humanity discovered advanced alien technology in the Toltec Indian mounds. Over the next 150 years, society embraces the technology and develops interstellar travel via the slipstream, all while retaining paranoid nationalism. When they encounter other human settlements on alien worlds, they chose to study them out of concern that "alien" use of slipstream technology puts them at risk.

**Albert Harred** is the descendent of one of the Slipstream discoverers. His drive to honor the family legacy leads him to turn his back on his new family and spend two years on a research orbital. As his tour wraps up, his orbital is attacked by anarchists, forcing him to abandon ship. The ship inexplicably navigates straight to the surface below. He crashes.

He awakes hostage on an alien world. He uses his knowledge of advanced technology to survive. He tries desperately to develop the means to return home while trying to maneuver in the real war on the alien planet. But, he must keep the alien humans from mastering the technology and awaking the real threat to his homeworld.

**Alien ruler** wants to dominate his wee continent. He paints himself as the victim and tries to seduce Albert (whom he calls "Herbert", which is a play on words) to support him with newfangled weapons. He wants a doomsday weapon. He is "Country."

**Alien scientist** works for AR. He's assigned to help with the doomsday weapon and steal ideas from Albert. His fanatical dedication to AR is slowly eroded by his interaction with Albert. He decides (or pretends to) help Albert get home. He is "Duty."

**Alien princess** is AR's daughter. She falls in love with Albert and wants him to fall in love with her. She is "Honor."

Contrast this with Albert's homeworld:

**Albert's Father** wants to keep his domination of industry. When his son is reported missing, he is split between serving his company and saving his son who is probably dead. "I have another."

**Albert's best Friend** was with him when they were attacked, and helped Albert escape. We learn early on this was a ruse to get rid of Albert so that his friend could go after the widow...

**Albert's wife & Family** she is heartbroken when he left, and mourns when she finds him reported missing. She is suspicious of the best friend, especially after he clearly makes advances to him. She is the steel that pushes Father to do something, and develops to be a force to be reckoned with.

## Theme

Duty. Honor. Country.

## Characters

<!-- Describe you main protagonist and other key characters in the series. Write less about their background and more about their current circumstances and shared conflict. A short paragraph for each is ideal. Clarify how they view their world, and how they relate to others. Create irony with their behavior. Find the flaw in a hero, and a redeeming quality in an antagonist.  -->
