1. [Grizzly Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Times_of_Grizzly_Adams) - a man who is forced out on his own and wants to return home.
2. [Macgyver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver) - a man who is able to solve problems with ingenuity

### Logline

A homesick slipstream scientist watches an alien society from space. When his orbital is attacked, he is forced to abandon ship and finds himself stranded on the planet's surface.

<!-- Write a short and powerful description of the core concept. Two sentences is ideal. A logline for a scripted series will often describe the main character's plight and unique circumstance that drives the story.  -->

### Format

a listing of key features of your series (number & length of episodes, structure of episodes, genre, release pattern)

### Audience

a narrative description of your target audience. This would be the anonymous “someone” you write to in your novels

### Logline

“A hotshot investment banker is forced to work as CFO of a struggling NASCAR team. His success comes from deal making and compromise, but the owner demands total victory and the team of misfits won’t compromise and come together as a team. The series asks whether community is more important than the individual.”

### Character (Who)

A brief summary of the central protagonist and why he must actively participate. [Breaking Bad: “Breaking Bad is the story of a man who is desperate to assert his impact on the world.”]

### Conflict (What)

A brief summary of the central conflict. [Breaking Bad: “He’s failed repeatedly in his past (even while others profited from his intelligence), and is now faced with terminal cancer. He is the smartest man around, and he’s going to prove it.”]

### Theme (Why)

A brief moral argument that is the series organizing principle, stated as a question. [Breaking Bad: Whether success in this world means one must become evil.]

### Story Pattern (How)

The basic flow of each episode. [Breaking Bad: “Walt has a problem. His solution works, but brings him into conflict with people more evil than himself. To solve that conflict, he must become more evil than they.”] Rabkin, William. Writing the Pilot: Creating the Series (p. 84). moon & sun & whiskey inc.. Kindle Edition.

## Synopsis

_**a one-page (4-5 paragraph) summary of the world, major characters and central tension.**_

<!-- Write an overview of the series idea, describing the world or setting it takes place in, the unique conflicts faced, and the dynamics between main characters that fuel the story. This is a great sales tool because you're going to highlight the most interesting facets and themes of the series. You should be able to do this in three paragraphs, but a few pages is ok so long as the writing is "tight" and reads efficiently, moving the story beat by beat. -->

In the 18th century, humanity discovered advanced alien technology in the Toltec Indian mounds. Over the next 150 years, society embraces the technology and develops interstellar travel via the slipstream, all while retaining paranoid nationalism. When they encounter other human settlements on alien worlds, they chose to study them out of concern that "alien" use of slipstream technology puts them at risk.
