## Concept

### Logline

A homesick slipstream scientist watches an alien society from space. When his orbital is attacked, he is forced to abandon ship and finds himself stranded on the planet's surface.

<!-- Write a short and powerful description of the core concept. Two sentences is ideal. A logline for a scripted series will often describe the main character's plight and unique circumstance that drives the story.  -->

### Synopsis

<!-- Write an overview of the series idea, describing the world or setting it takes place in, the unique conflicts faced, and the dynamics between main characters that fuel the story. This is a great sales tool because you're going to highlight the most interesting facets and themes of the series. You should be able to do this in three paragraphs, but a few pages is ok so long as the writing is "tight" and reads efficiently, moving the story beat by beat. -->

In the 18th century, humanity discovered advanced alien technology in the Toltec indian mounds. 

## Theme

## Characters

<!-- Describe you main protagonist and other key characters in the series. Write less about their background and more about their current circumstances and shared conflict. A short paragraph for each is ideal. Clarify how they view their world, and how they relate to others. Create irony with their behavior. Find the flaw in a hero, and a redeeming quality in an antagonist.  -->
