# Notes

##  The 90-Day Screenplay

* There is a difference between problem and dilemma. The character has a problem & goal (the plot) and over the course of the story encounters challenges that impede his obtaining the goal. "If I only had a better job, or that promotion." Until they shift their perspective, the character can't grown and move beyond...they have to learn that it's not the goal that addresses the problem, but a paradigm shift. There is a Lie believed, a truth to be accepted, and a compelling desire.
* The story revolves around how all the characters seek to address the centra dilemma.
* Writing a Novella is the same as writing a Screenplay...it's about word-economy. Stick to the word-count and tell the story as efficiently as you can.
* "When we know we are channels, we take the pressure off." In other words, I need to recognize that my writing is God's communication instead of my own.
* While in writing a Screenplay the writer does very little to discuss camera, the long-fiction writer does all of the camera angles, etc.
