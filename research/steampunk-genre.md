# Steampunk

What I am writing is not related to [Gaslamp Fantasy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaslampFantasy) because I am not dealing with anything supernatural.

  - Enlightenment suggests that Science will fix everything, for which Romanticism countered that it would not. Science Fiction tends toward Enlightenment, but successful SciFi tends to be Romantic.

* [TV Trope: Steampunk](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk)
  - Firefly, while not strictly steampunk, does contain a lot of steampunk themes (mixing 19th century aesthetics with sci-fi elements and storylines) as well as steampunk character types such as the Wrench Wench, and went a long way toward popularizing the genre.

  - unlike the dystopianness of Cyberpunk, readers are more romantic about the 19th Century.
  - "Not all [Victorian] period pieces are Steampunk--only those which are deliberately anachronistic technological advances."
  - "Those interested in writing Steampunk should choose what exactly they wish to say about the time-period and/or modern situations."]

### Genre Setting

* [TV Trope: Alternate History](https://www.notion.so/merovex/Alternate-History-TV-Tropes-1e4e862a49d2451ebb884f684891b0b5)
* [TV Trope: Alternate History Trope](https://www.notion.so/merovex/Alternate-History-Tropes-TV-Tropes-365d1e7e154443d1bb2eb93ac6430854)
* [TV Trope: Sliding Scale of ALt History Plausibility](https://www.notion.so/merovex/Sliding-Scale-of-Alternate-History-Plausibility-TV-Tropes-7ed83b48d296480e8422cbc813c66f5d)
* [TV Trope: Rule of Cool](https://www.notion.so/merovex/Rule-of-Cool-TV-Tropes-59a81741c2f749878b024715218181b6)

### History

* [TV Trope: Regency England](https://www.notion.so/merovex/Regency-England-TV-Tropes-0519dc1f3fca4349ae1bd527aa12f417) Strictly the period from 1811-1820 when George IV was regent over George III. But, in literature covers the period from the end of the Seven-Year's War to Victoria. (1760-1840)

### Technology

* [TV Trope: Alternate Techline](https://www.notion.so/merovex/Alternate-Techline-TV-Tropes-ae7af13861774832abc9e8f0976d526b)
* [TV Trope: Schizo Tech](https://www.notion.so/merovex/Schizo-Tech-TV-Tropes-3a7e59d59f9f4d55a956c8f150683756) This hits the nail on the head in terms of having wildly diverging tech due to ... (Stranded is Schizo Tech.)
* [TV Trope: Advanced Ancient Acropolis](https://www.notion.so/merovex/Advanced-Ancient-Acropolis-TV-Tropes-81869d4fc1d143fb9b87595730b73a9e) like Wonder Woman's home, so this is not a part of my thing. Any schizotech is tied to a dead society.

### Science

* [TV Trope: Applied Phlebotinum](https://www.notion.so/c683ce2178204b8aac4515f2c4540057) - Soft science material fuel. - Series use of the Cubes & Cosmic radiation is appears to be Applied Phlebotinum, But
* [TV Trope: Minovsky Physics](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics) (A fictional item or substance which has strictly and clearly defined limits on what it can do.) This implies that most of the science is right, allowing for <abbr title="The fictional world is exactly like the real world except where noted otherwise.">[Like Reality Unless Noted](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted)</abbr>
