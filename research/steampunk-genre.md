# Steampunk

What I am writing is not related to [Gaslamp Fantasy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaslampFantasy) because I am not dealing with anything supernatural.

  - Enlightenment suggests that Science will fix everything, for which Romanticism countered that it would not. Science Fiction tends toward Enlightenment, but successful SciFi tends to be Romantic.

  - Firefly, while not strictly steampunk, does contain a lot of steampunk themes (mixing 19th century aesthetics with sci-fi elements and storylines) as well as steampunk character types such as the Wrench Wench, and went a long way toward popularizing the genre.

> * Technology and devices driven by steam power or counterweighted clockwork
> * Victorian-era class and economic structures
> * Implicit or explicit social critique
> * An adventure-oriented plotline
> * An emphasis on the empowerment of individuals in the face of industrial standardization and the advance of modern bureaucratic government
