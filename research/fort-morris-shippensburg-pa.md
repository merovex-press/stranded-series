# Fort Morris

## Construction of Fort Morris

On July 9, 1755, Edward Morris, the governor of Shippensburg ordered that a fort be built after he learned of General Braddock’s defeat at the hands of the French and Indians. His intent was to provide protection for the troops and colonists during the French and Indian War. So, over the next year, several buildings, a 70'-deep well, and a log palisade were built. Fort Morris was garrisoned until the early 1760’s, but preserved for several more years due to the efforts of Edward Shippen. Also, there is a record that an officer and eighteen provincial troops were stationed in Shippensburg during the winter of 1763-1764  

On March 24, 1761, Shippen wrote, “I desire everybody in Shippensburg to take care of ye Fort for I will suffer a log of it to be thrown down on any pretense whatever.” 

## Description of Fort Morris’ Dimensions

General Forbes described Fort Morris as “a regular square with four bastions and one gate in that curtain which faces due east towards the town. There are three swivel guns on the salient angles of SE, SW, and NW bastions, but none on the NE. These guns are so fix’d in at they can’t be pointed to any object, but in one horizontal line. Loopholes are in many places entirely wanting, and where they are, are badly and irregularly cut, being only about four feet from the ground on the outside, tho’ more in some places on the inside. There are nine huts and houses within the fort sufficient for Barracks, magazine, and storehouse for about 150-200 men, a good draw-well, and an oven.”   The proportions of Fort Morris are described in a memorandum written on August 13, 1758 by Brigadier-General John Forbes after visiting the fort.
