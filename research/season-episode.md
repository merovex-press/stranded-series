# Writing Seasons

**Summary.** Expect a maximum of 3 seasons with 12-episodes per season to be peak value. At ~30Kwords per novella

## Season Length

* [TV Trope: 12-Episode Anime](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime) 12-14 episode seasons, typically 13 long with 12 shown during the season and the last as a bonus (a.k.a. OAV).
* [TV Trope: British Brevity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity) - British shows are intentionally shorter than American ones.
  - Tend to run 12-episodes if dramatic, 6 if comedies.
  - Useful to avoid [Continuity Lock-Out](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockOut) in order to put a higher production budget into each and making it easier to catch up
  - [Netflix follows 10-episode seasons](https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2454848/why-netflix-stared-using-the-13-episode-season-structure) though it started with a 13-episode season.
  - [Business Insider states](https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-favors-tv-shows-with-10-episode-seasons-report-2019-3) that Netflix doesn't like to go more than 3-seasons of 10-episodes.
  - [Hyperable](https://www.hypable.com/10-episode-tv-season-doesnt-work/) argues 12-episodes is ideal as it gives more time for a story to conclude
* [TV Trope: Season Fluidity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFluidity) sliding scale of relationship of episodes & seasons.
  - Likely Abrupt, with each series being a different era, etc.
* [TV Trope: Arc Welding](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding) - A series that so far has been episodic, retcons itself so that it's all linked in a story-arcing plot. Occurs when [TV Trope: Continuity Creep](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCreep) has taken hold.
* [TV Trope: Canon Welding](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding) The creator combines their previous works into one series.
* [TV Trope: Mythic Arc](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc) A Story Arc that spans the entire series.

## Episode Breakdown

From [Bang2Write](http://bang2write.com/2008/05/plot-construction-2-dangling.html):

* US Episode
  - A-Story - Major Case
  - B-Story - Minor Case / parallel story line run by secondary characters
  - C-Story - Series Element / Runner
* Old UK
  - A-Story - Story of the week
  - B-Story - Sub-Plot (maybe Series Element, maybe not)
* New UK
  - A-Story - Story of the week
  - B-Story - Series Element / Runner

Notes:

* Series Element & Runner are the same thing.
* GoT had each story as a Character Herd plot

**Characterization Note:** Each character will have an "Approach" to how they handle a problem, and will each try their approach. So add "problem solving approach" to their bios.

### [What is Drama](https://www.tv-calling.com/show-dont-tell-mamet-rules-and-breaking-bad/)

Question: What is drama? drama, again, is the quest of the hero to overcome those things which prevent him from achieving a specific, *acute* goal.

So: we, the writers, must ask ourselves *of every scene* these three questions.

1) who wants what?
2) what happens if her don’t get it?
3) why now?

This means all the “little” expositional scenes of two people talking about a third. This bushwah (and we all tend to write it on the first draft) is less than useless, should it finally, God forbid, get filmed.

Every scene must be dramatic. That means: the main character must have a simple, straightforward, pressing need which impels him or her to show up in the scene.

This need is why they *came*. It is what the scene is about. Their attempt to get this need met *will* lead, at the end of the scene,to *failure* – this is how the scene is *over*. It, this failure, will, then, of necessity, propel us into the *next* scene.

All these attempts, taken together, will, over the course of the episode, constitute the *plot*.

Any scene, thus, which does not both advance the plot, and standalone (that is, dramatically, by itself, on its own merits) is either superfluous, or incorrectly written.

## Arcs

* [TV Trope: Cast Herd](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastHerd) Large cast split into groups. They have a herd leader, who speaks to/for the herd and is the only one seen in an OAV.
* [TV Trope: Rotating Arcs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RotatingArcs)
  - Focus on a certain, small (~3-7 characters) subset of the cast, ignore all the other characters for the duration, and flesh out the smaller group's individual personalities and relationships to each other for the time it takes to complete a Story Arc. That time may be as short as one episode/issue, but is usually a run of several.
  - Each Herd is a Storyline.

## Plotting the Season

### Hauge's Summary

>Since we already know the heroes and are familiar with their everyday lives from all the previous episodes, the opening scene is usually the Opportunity (the 10% turning point in a feature film). The heroes then move immediately into the New Situation. From there the structure is basically identical: after the heroes figure out what the new situation is, they begin pursuing a visible goal that will carry them to the end of the episode."
[Michael Hauge](https://www.storymastery.com/story/structuring-tv-series-episodes/)

### Reddit on Dexter

> The first few seasons of Dexter are very good at framing each season with a new and interesting dynamic that throws up new questions about Dexter's life, and these questions go on to define the story and evolve his character in an interesting way.
> * Can Dexter ever have a truly honest friendship?
> * Can Dexter be a father, a family man and a killer?
> * Can Dexter use religion to substitute his morality when raising his son?
> * How can Dexter leave the dark passenger behind?
>
> Each season hinges on a broader question that can define new elements of his character, or change what was already there. That's how it generated 96 episodes, at least half of which were very good television indeed.
>
> The question "how will this concept generate a hundred episodes" is a broad, big-picture question that has nothing to do with act breaks and subplots - it's about keeping your lead character interesting by constantly challenging them with shifting dynamics.

### Quora with Writer Season Grid

> I would say that generally that the closest thing to a commonly used structure for season long arcs (at least for one-hour drama) is the 'whiteboard grid.'
>
>All the shows i've been on, and in most of the shows that i have visited to see friends or whatever, there will be a large whiteboard that is split into a giant grid. The columns are episodes - so the left-most column is episode 1 and the right-most column is the season finale (either ep 13 or 22 usually).
>
>The columns are horizontally split by anywhere from 8 to 15 lines. So that there is a variable number of boxes in each column. The first column might have 8 boxes, the second might have 14, the third might have 10...
>
>So for each episode, major plot points/turns are written in the boxes of the column. When we start working, the grid only has the pilot filled in (since this has already been shot typically). As we work, we begin to fill in more and more of the grid.
>
>When working on each individual episode, they get their own whiteboard (or three) and the big grid will often get ignored for days. But whenever we need to reminded of where we're headed or need to make sure that we're not getting ourselves tangled up by plot, we can look at the big grid for guidance.
>
>When we need to present to the network/studio our plans for the season, they will come into the room and we'll show them this big grid as we explain the overall plan.
>
> I've seen people taking pictures of the grid but strangely, I've never seen the grid transferred to paper. Probably because it does the most good by being up and in your face at all times. If we had to go looking for that sheet of paper with the season long arcs on it, we'd do it a lost less.
