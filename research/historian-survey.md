# Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions

The Journal of Economic History
Vol. 55, No. 1 (Mar., 1995), pp. 139-154 (16 pages)

* British North America whites were among the most affluent.
* Colonial debt not a powerful cause of the revolution, nor was the behavior of British merchants to cramp Colonial style.
* Trade and Navigation Act restrictions were painful, but the burden of economic policies did not spark the revolution
* Delegates did not generally vote based on their personal economic interests

> Three disparate questions deal with the colonial economy. There is an overwhelming consensus that Americans' economic standard of living on the eve of the Revolution was among the highest in the world. Likewise, a vast majority accept the view that indentured servitude was an economic arrangement designed to iron out imperfections in the capital market. Neither of the statements had generated heated discussion recently in like of the well-known works by Alice Hanson Jones and David Galenson.
> The third colonial era topic has been the subject of much argument. New Left historians, such as James Henretta, have laid out the case that many 18th century farmers were economically isolated, but this was rejected in the survey.
> Four of the questions deal with causes of the American Revolution. There is a consensus on some of the narrower propositions: that debts owed by colonists and the practices of British merchants were not primary causes of the revolution; and that the costs of the Navigation Acts' trade restrictions were small. Nonetheless, almost half of the economic historians believe that the economic burden of the British policies was "the spark" to the American Revolution. Most who favor this position, however, do so with provisos. The bottom line is that there is no consensus on whether the economic burdens of British policies sparked the colonists' bid for independence
> At the beginning of the century, Charles Beard laid out the case for an economic interpretation of the making of the U.S. Constitution. Among other things, he argued that the _personal_ economic interests of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention had a significant effect on their actions in writing the Constitution. Although historians are divided on the question, the consensus among economists in the EHA is that this proposition is correct.
