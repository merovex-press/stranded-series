# So, who reads science fiction anyway?

January 9, 2019

The last blog generated a discussion of whether science fiction can be called conservative at all because of its nature as speculative fiction. Following up online, I see opposing opinions about whether science fiction is inherently conservative or inherently liberal. There’s not nearly as much research on the demographics of the speculative fiction market as there should be, but in this post, I’ll try to have a look at some results.

First, what kind of people in general read science fiction? One writer-conducted market survey found that science fiction readers account for about 20% of the US population, are wealthier than the average, are about 57 percent male and tend to reduce their reading volume between the ages of 45-65. Also—no surprise—SF readers are people who read a lot. One study found that speculative fiction fans consistently consume high volumes of books, TV and films, which the authors considered “cognitively beneficial.” This study also found that SF as a genre has a strong effect on the way the public perceives and accepts science. Another study showed that science fiction in popular culture has a real effect on public attitudes. The authors suggest this is a literacy effect, where consuming scary media about “killer robots,” for example, affected opinions about development of autonomous weapons.

Other research shows that science fiction readers are more mature in their social relationships than readers of other genres. Fans who scored as knowledgeable about SF on the Genre Familiarity Test also scored higher on the Relationships Belief Inventory, while romance readers scored lower. In contrast, another study found that readers of romance and suspense/thrillers had higher interpersonal sensitivity/empathy scores than science-fiction/fantasy fans. Again, this isn’t really a surprise.

People read fiction for a variety of reasons, and escapism seems to be high on the list. Education is likely up there, too, where people are interested in broadening their horizons—science fiction is supposed to be the literature of ideas, after all. However, most of us would still like to read texts that reaffirm our beliefs and values rather than something that challenges them. That leads us to the question of worldviews (i.e. politics). So how do worldviews affect reading habits?

Here’s an interesting study that found a preference for different disciplines in science reading material. For example, liberals tend to like theoretical disciplines including anthropology, biology, astronomy, physics and (surprise) engineering. On the other hand, conservatives tend to prefer applied disciplines including medicine, law and (surprise) climate change. Analyzing the results, the authors conclude that “scientific puzzles appeal more to the left, while problem-solving appeals more to the right.”

Another study conducted on Goodreads found that conservatives tend to prefer escapist, “low-brow” genre fiction and recent book-to-movie titles, and liberals tend to read more “high-brow” novels that win prizes. According to the authors, these results support the worst, polarizing stereotypes of “sophisticated” readers (liberals) versus “simple-minded” readers of formulaic fiction (conservatives). However, the authors also discovered a sizable number of non-partisan books that bridged the gap between liberals and conservatives. And, it turned out to be generally conservatives who were more engaged in producing this space for cultural compromise.

I didn’t find anything at all about the relative size of the conservative versus liberal audience, which suggests it’s a topic for original research. Anybody?

> Before you could conduct such a study, you’d probably have to settle first what ‘should’ be considered SF and F; personally if I were going to do such a broad thing, I’d go with ‘Everything from 20-minutes-into the future, space opera, to the hardest Mohs-scale-of Sci-fi = Sci-Fi; and everything from romantic urban fantasy to huge epics like Wheel of Time and LotR = Fantasy’. Because SF is kind of an overarching umbrella genre under which there are several sub-genres; same with Fantasy. I wouldn’t toss out YA from the category either. And then you’d have problems because the nitpicky would go after the ‘validity’ of your study because it doesn’t fit with their definition. At which point that’s usually where such a study wouldn’t likely occur, because this is about as virtually religious in fanaticism to a number of people as hard-core Mac users. The snobs would refuse to be ‘put next to’ (insert the thing that they look down on here) and decry such a study as racist/sexist/-phobic/evil somehow (even though it isn’t.)

> And where would one slot Steampunk and it’s sibling -punk genres? Or Magitech? Would we include translated to English literature – which opens up to say, Metro 2033, the Witcher novels, and every single translated light novel and comic out there like Spice and Wolf, Sword Art Online, and even Miraculous Ladybug, a series aimed at children but apparently has a fair audience amongst teens and up.d by 1 person

> All studies have limitations. Right now I’m looking at Amazon as a possible source for data, which means you could use their definition of SF versus fantasy. There might be a few errors of classification, but you could toss those out. Once you’ve defined the kind of reading material the different worldviews like, then you have a clue about who’s driving the best seller titles.d by 1 person

### Cora Jan 10, 2019 @ 17:30:52

> The problem is that Amazon’s classification is a mix of self-classification by publishers and classification via keywords. Both can and frequently do lead to misclassifications, e.g. a lot of urban fantasy and paranormal romance books wind up classified as “sword & sorcery”, because Amazon puts anything that uses the keywords “dragon”, “witch” or “magic” into sword and sorcery. Meanwhile, erotic romances with a very thin SF veneer and titles like “Taken by the Alien Warlord” or “Interstellar Mail Order Bride” frequently end up in the SF categories.

> You’ll also get very different demographics depending on whether you include YA and science fiction romance (both likely tend younger, more female and more left), whether you include post-apocalyptic prepper fiction (seems to tend more male and more conservative) or dystopian fiction published by literary and mainstream imprints (probably tends more female and more left).

### Shadowdancer Duskstar / Cutelildrow Jan 10, 2019 @ 21:05:13

> I’d agree with your possible source for data, as ultimately the classifications are for ‘virtual shelving’ purposes.

> Some authors seem to play with the genre preconceptions which makes this fun. Troll Mountain by Matthew Reilly plays on the whole fantasy tropes but picked apart, it’s more of a science fiction story, becoming so because the setting’s people are very primitive, and no actual magic tropes come into play. Most of his books, especially the stand-alone ones, I’d slot into ‘science fiction’ bleeding over to adventure thriller.

### greghullender Jan 10, 2019 @ 11:13:55

> It’s not really that hard to identify the genres of short stories. I classify about 800 stories per year, and maybe 5 are ambiguous. At least, if you use my definitions. 🙂

> The major splits are Hard vs. Soft SF and High vs. Low Fantasy. I define Hard SF as SF where the science/technology is the focus of the story. High Fantasy is fantasy set in a secondary world. Obviously there’s little confusion between those two.

> You’d think the challenge would be to distinguish Soft SF from Low Fantasy, but, as I said above, it’s rarely a problem. Low Fantasy is set in our world (or something close to it) but with magic and/or supernatural creatures. Soft SF may have technology that’s hard to tell from magic, but the people in the stories take it for granted and don’t think of it as magic at all.

> Future Fantasy stories, like Star Wars, where you have magic but you also have high technology are probably the most debatable, but even there it’s usually pretty clear, and, regardless, those are rare.

> I classify Steampunk as a special type of alternate-history fantasy set in the 1800s. (I class all alternate-history under low fantasy.)

### Lela E. Buis Jan 10, 2019 @ 19:07:09

> In this case, I don’t think a strict definition is really necessary. Thin SF settings with romance and adventure elements are exactly what “low brow” readers are looking for, while “high brow” types will be looking more for literary elements like subtext and meaning. Nobody in either group really cares about the hardness scale.

> I skimmed through the book descriptions on the Amazon SF best seller list and only found 1 of the top 20 that seemed straight fantasy. I think The Handmaid’s Tale would be the only clear liberal text, and maybe Bird Box? The list is stuffed with SF romance, military SF and a couple or three thrillers. Looks pretty low brow today.

> If you forgive me for saying so, I said nothing about short stories, though I understand what you’re trying to say (You’re trying to give what you do as an example). I ranged ALL the stories, anywhere from phone chapter serials, to, to webcomics, to epic novel series.

> And I didn’t split ‘low’ or ‘high’. I put them into the two base categories of Science Fiction, and Fantasy.

> Just those two.

> Mind, you peripherally proved my second point, where the snobbery (of high and low, for example, and ‘short stories’ never even featured as an exclusion) comes in, versus ‘which pile to put this in’.

> I would submit that there are stories which would fall into a grey area I’d call science-fantasy. Magitech-featuring stories, some steampunk-themed fantasy could qualify.

> Alt history would really depend on how it was approached, as blanket tossing them into ‘low fantasy’ does discredit to ‘what if’ science fiction centric alternate history, so I politely disagree with your approach, as if we were simply to toss all ‘what if this had happened in history instead’ into the fantasy pile, we may as well just get rid of the ‘science fiction’ part of the genre and label it all Fantasy, as we’re simply fantasizing anyway. Sarah Hoyt’s and Kevin J. Anderson’s Uncharted is fantasy centric alternate history versus what is popularly called ‘atom punk’ (think rayguns, aliens, flying cars, the Jetsons) or pure steampunk, or dieselpunk, or even a speculative history-setting of South America with Mayan technology as a huge part of it’s concepts – all going into ‘what if’ with a science concept base. Similarly, a story with vikings and aliens would have no magic involved, but Sufficiently Advanced Technology instead, thus falling under Sci-Fi.

> “I didn’t find anything at all about the relative size of the conservative versus liberal audience, which suggests it’s a topic for original research.”

> It is very hard to find any decent data on the size of the audience at all, much less regional breakdowns. In this day and age, that’s interesting. We -know- the data exists, because data regarding retail and web sales is recorded in excruciatingly fine detail.

> Data regarding conservative vs. Liberal, also missing. Facebook/Amazon/Google knows, for sure, but they’re not telling.

> But here’s something to consider regarding the relative size of audience. First, the Hard Sciences and Engineering are the last intellectual refuge of Conservatism. The Arts and the Social Sciences, Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology, these are the power base of the Left. They’ve been utterly taken over.

> The Left for example continues to try to shame Engineering into graduating more women and People of Color, but the numbers don’t change much. The demands of the profession weed out people who are not fascinated by computer code, or the performance specs of mild steel rivets, or what have you. Women tend not to be interested in rivets.

> So chances are that anyone involved in or interested in hard sciences will tend conservative. This argues against the notion that SF readers are mostly Lefties. Lefties tend not to care about rivets either.d by 1 person

### Cora Jan 10, 2019 @ 17:36:03

> Engineering and hard science trending conservative is a North American phenomenon, though. In Germany, the engineering and science departments of universities are still male dominated, ditto for companies in the respective fields (I’ve frequently been the only women in a room full of men), but those men aren’t necessarily any more conservative than the average population. And some countries in Asia and the Middle East, where you wouldn’t necessarily expect it, have a whole lot of female engineering and science students.

### Lela E. Buis Jan 10, 2019 @ 18:46:11

> Yeah, you have to be able to deal with the math and the rivets. Women in the US have plenty of choice but seem more inclined toward people professions like health care or teaching.

### thephantom182 Jan 10, 2019 @ 21:42:27

> Cora said: “In Germany, the engineering and science departments of universities are still male dominated, ditto for companies in the respective fields…”

> Yes. Exactly. Even in super-duper Progressive Germany, those hard science fields are -still- male “dominated.” Or, more in line with my formulation, they are male populated. Because most women simply are not interested. Same in Sweden, if the news stories can be trusted.

> Conversely, in the medical profession graduating female medical students outnumber men. They go on to become very successful doctors. Women are very interested in medicine and healthcare. The exceptions are radiology and surgery. Those are extremely technical, and women are not rushing to fill those jobs.

> > Cora said: “… but those men aren’t necessarily any more conservative than the average population.”

> If you ask them what’s more important on a spaceship, gender identity or rivets, they will say rivets. If you ask an art student, they will say gender identity. The hard-science dude knows that gender identity will not matter if the rivets are too hard and shatter in the cold, letting all the air out.

> That’s what a Conservative is. He’s the one thinking about the technical issues first.

> So a Conservative science fiction story is one where things like construction methods and human error play a part in the plot. “The prototype crashed because of a contractor trying to do too good a job and making the rivets too strong. Then the ship is subjected to rapid heat cycling because its rotating in the sun, and the over-spec parts cause cracks, and then kapow! The skin fell off.”

> Meanwhile the literature student is screaming “WHAT’S THAT GOT TO DO WITH GENDER IDENTITY?!!!”

> All I’m saying is the literature student, in SFF fandom, small “f”, is wildly outnumbered. Nobody cares about gender. Everybody wants to see Spaceman Slim figure out the rivet thing, and save the sexy stewardess.

> There you go. Next book, the hot tip is rivets.d by 1 person

> From my experience, what balances out entry into sciences and engineering, sexes-wise, is ‘is there money to be made there’ and an expectation of family support/returns, and a culture thereof. Then the only barrier is the ability and the will, as money can be obtained if one is willing to be a swot (there are sponsored tuition grants and scholarships but the grade requirements for those tend to be rather high, and the mediocre will not make it) and willing to keep focused on the goal versus getting distracted by extraneous, unimportant things.d by 1 person

> There has to be a better way to gather these statistics than keywords! How about polling at some SFF conventions, actually take the pulse of real people in the research? As a long-time fan of a once popular SF TV show, one of our fan bulletin boards bemoaned this very fact. At conventions, you will see a lot of highly educated, degreed older women with considerable disposable income who read and watch SFF in all its myriad forms, but we are not represented in the research, which skews toward young males. Get on any fan board of any popular SFF book and ask your questions, visit a convention or two and you’ll get a whole other take on who the fans are!

> And also, are these numbers further skewed by having Horror lumped into the category? It galls me every time I go into a bookstore to find SciFi/Horror/Fantasy all in the same section. *shakes head*

### Lela E. Buis Nov 25, 2019 @ 19:12:35

> Thanks for checking in. I’m not sure this is caused by a scarcity of data. TV is a special case. As I understand it, even a popular TV show can be cancelled if the audience is wrong. Payment scales for ads pay higher rates for younger viewers, and especially for younger male viewers. This demographic is expected to have the most disposable income and the most willingness to spend it. The same scale rates older women at lowest desirability. That means this demographic is just out of luck.

> I’ll bet there’s some similar bias in books. Certainly very few seem to aim at older women.
