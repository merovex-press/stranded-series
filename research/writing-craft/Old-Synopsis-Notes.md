#### Create a Mood Board

Including something like a Moodboard in your Show Bible can allow you to go even further when defining the tone of your project. Give us a look at the world, on an even broader canvas. Think of it as a chance to fully create the world your show takes place in. With no budget.

#### Style / Tone

The tone section should include a style you wish to emulate or emphasize. Reference projects and styles you find inspiring.

Discuss any rules that you think should govern the tone of this series to make it unique: "Everything will be handheld to give the show a raw, lived in feeling, despite the glossy sci-fi production design."

Create juxtapositions between your concept and your "look" that make your show dynamic.
What type of score will you use? Somber? Electronic? Does the show have a generally negative outlook? Positive? How should that manifest in each plot? These are instructions for future writers as well as executives.
