## Audience

<!-- Customer Segments: Who are the customers? What do they think? See? Feel? Do? -->

1. **Laura the Lay Christian.** Laura is a middle-aged Christian (33-45) who wants to get closer to her faith. She feels that she wants to learn more about being a Christian, and influence her family to grow closer as well. The problem she has is there are a wide range of books to read from, and she samples based on what she hears from friends.
2. **Charlie the Christian Author.** Charlie is a minor or self-published Christian author, who would like other ways of marketing his book. He is looking for another source of validation of his work.

## Value Proposition
